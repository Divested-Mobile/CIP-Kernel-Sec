   Multiple ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC) device drivers do not pad
   frames with null bytes, which allows remote attackers to obtain information
   from previous packets or kernel memory by using malformed packets, as
   demonstrated by Etherleak.

    A number of drivers had to be fixed, but when looking to see where this
    patch had been applied, I just tracked the de600.c file changes.  My
    assumption is that all of the other drivers got fixed at the same time.
    I've e-mailed the security team + mdz, asking for a patch
