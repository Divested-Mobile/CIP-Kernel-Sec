   Linux kernel 2.4.10 through 2.4.21-pre4 does not properly handle the
   O_DIRECT feature, which allows local attackers with write privileges to
   read portions of previously deleted files, or cause file system
   corruption.

    The big O_DIRECT issues we had a while ago involved redoing large parts of
    the locking so it's definitily not the patch above.  It was fixed in 2.4.2x
    for x = 2 or 3 IIRC.  The 2.5.27 kernels in sarge ff are definitly okay.

    It looks like the fix that was used in woody is to diable
    O_DIRECT.  Is this the upstream fix?

    and here's his response:
    Therefore, I'm marking >= sarge kernels N/A
