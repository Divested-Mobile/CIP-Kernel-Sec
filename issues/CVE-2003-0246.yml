   The ioperm system call in Linux kernel 2.4.20 and earlier does not properly
   restrict privileges, which allows local users to gain read or write access to
   certain I/O ports.

    It looks like the patch originally included in woody was just a one line

    moving our trees forward to the upstream one.

    Patch is x86 only.
