   The kernel strncpy function in Linux 2.4 and 2.5 does not %NUL pad
   the buffer on architectures other than x86, as opposed to the expected
   behavior of strncpy as implemented in libc, which could lead to
   information leaks.

    2.4.27-8 fixes s390x, ppc64 and s390 but leaves mips & alpha unfixed.

    Since this is minor, I'm gonna consider the existing patch "good enough"
    and mark the 2.4 issues as complete.

    N.B. This bug appears to be minor at best

    Alan Cox wrote in above URL that these will be addressed during the 2.5
    cycle, so I guess it's pretty safe to make all the 2.6 kernels as fixed
    The ramifications are minor anyway
