   The XFS file system code in Linux 2.4.x has an information leak in which
   in-memory data is written to the device for the XFS file system, which
   allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the raw device.

comments:
  debian/dannf: |-
    I never did find the actual patch - upstream fixed versions are
    based on the securityfocus page above.
  debian/jmm: Woody is not affected, as XFS was only added to the kernel in 2.4.25
