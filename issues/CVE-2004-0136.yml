    Strange description, but I think this is actually a Linux issue; note the
    RedHat URLs above.
    + mitre references a RedHat advisory for this, RHSA-2004:504-13
    + RHSA-2004:504-13 does in fact reference CVE-2004-0136
    + RedHat notes that their fixed src.rpm is kernel-2.4.18-e.52.src.rpm
    + The changelog in the spec file in the above .src.rpm contains the following
    entry:
    * Tue Nov 16 2004 Jim Paradis <jparadis@redhat.com>
    - Fixes for security holes in binfmt_elf loader (Dave Anderson,
    Jim Paradis), bugs 127916, 134876
    + https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=127916 references
    CVE-2004-0136, but the patches it links to are the fixes for
    CVE-2004-0138

    I think I've traced this issue back to a flawed bug report, and that
    this is really CAN-2004-0138.

    Red Hat accidentally used CVE-2004-0138 for this in an advisory, pulling
    over the entries from it
    I've verified that the fix from
    http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/gnupatch@4021346f79nBb-4X_usRikR3Iyb4Vg
    is included in 2.6.8, thus marking 2.6.8 and linux-2.6 N/A
