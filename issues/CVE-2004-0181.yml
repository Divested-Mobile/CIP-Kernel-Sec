   The JFS file system code in Linux 2.4.x has an information leak in which
   in-memory data is written to the device for the JFS file system, which allows
   local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the raw device.

    JFS was merged into the 2.4 kernel in 2.4.20-pre4 and into 2.6 at 2.6.5-rc2,
    so I'm marking all versions N/A
