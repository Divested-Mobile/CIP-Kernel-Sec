   The linux-2.4.21-mlock.patch in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 does not properly
   maintain the mlock page count when one process unlocks pages that belong to
   another process, which allows local users to mlock more memory than specified
   by the rlimit.

    It doesn't look like the code in linux-2.4.21-mlock.patch was ever
    accepted upstream in 2.4 or 2.6, so it doesn't apply to us.
