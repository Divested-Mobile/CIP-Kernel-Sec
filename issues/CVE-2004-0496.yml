  debian/dannf: "I wasn't able to find the patches for this, but the description and\n\
    vendor advisories only note 2.6, so I'm assuming these are 2.6-only.\nThe description\
    \ says this affects < 2.6.7.  2.6.7 contains a bunch\nof sparse fixes in the changelog,\
    \ so I'll label upstream \nas fixed in 2.6.7."
