   Floating point information leak in the context switch code for Linux 2.4.x
   only checks the MFH bit but does not verify the FPH owner, which allows local
   users to read register values of other processes by setting the MFH bit.

    I've verified that the check for FPH ownership is included in stock 2.6.8:
    # define switch_to(prev,next,last) do {                                         \
    if (ia64_psr(ia64_task_regs(prev))->mfh && ia64_is_local_fpu_owner(prev)) {
    So it's N/A, but I don't know at which time it was fixed upstream
