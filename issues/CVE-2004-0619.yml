   Integer overflow in the ubsec_keysetup function for Linux Broadcom 5820
   cryptonet driver allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash)
   and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative add_dsa_buf_bytes
   variable, which leads to a buffer overflow.

    I've checked 2.6.8, 2.4.27 and 2.6.14, this is not included in the
    stock kernel, only in Red Hat's. I'm marking Woody N/A as well.
