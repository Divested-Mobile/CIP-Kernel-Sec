   The tcp_find_option function of the netfilter subsystem in Linux kernel 2.6,
   when using iptables and TCP options rules, allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (CPU consumption by infinite loop) via a large option length
   that produces a negative integer after a casting operation to the char type.

    The bug was introduced during a rewrite of the code that accesses the skb's
    during earlier 2.6 kernels. 2.4 has the correct u_int8_t declaration.
