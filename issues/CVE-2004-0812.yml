   Intel EM64T architectures, associated with "setting up TSS limits," allows
   local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
   arbitrary code.

    I've verified that above bkbits fixed is included in 2.6.8, so I'm
    marking 2.6 N/A
    The vulnerable code doesn't seem to be present in 2.4.27. Plus, 2.4
    is unsupported for amd64 anyway, so I'm marking it N/A as well for
    the 2.4 kernels
