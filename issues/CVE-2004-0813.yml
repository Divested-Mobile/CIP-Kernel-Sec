    That should clean things up for 2.6. \n2.4 doesn't suffer this problem exactly,\
    \ unless\nthe permisions of /dev/sg* are botched.\nAlan Cox seems to think that\

    RedHat is still vulnerable, but there has been recent activity:
    I wonder if one of the patches listed for CVE-2004-1190 fixes this?
  debian/horms: I'm pretty sure this is fixed by the series of patches for SG_IO
  debian/jmm: |-
    Marking 2.4 as N/A, as only local config mistakes would make that
    a problem
