  debian/jmm: "Quoting from http://groups.google.com/group/nz.comp/msg/71ec927b491f247d:\
    \ \nThe bug, discovered by Richard Hart, does not affect the 2.4 series kernel\n\
    Quoting from http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2004_37_kernel.html:\n\
    This problem has already been fixed in the 2.6.8 upstream Linux kernel,\nthis\
    \ update contains a backport of the fix.\nSo I'm marking all kernels N/A"
