   SUSE Linux before 9.1 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server before 9 do not
   properly check commands sent to CD devices that have been opened read-only,
   which could allow local users to conduct unauthorized write activities to
   modify the firmware of associated SCSI devices.
   .
   dannf> skipping for 2.4/sarge3 - not sure if 2.4 is affected, but we should
          revisit
