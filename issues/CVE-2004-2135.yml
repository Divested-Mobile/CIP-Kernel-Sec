  \ with a block \n size 1024 or greater, has certain \"IV computation\" weaknesses\

  debian: |-
    - i am 99% sure that these issues still affect the latest kernels
    - debian-installer only supports loop-aes and dm-crypt (i believe),
    which are known to be not affected by these issues, so most users
    are not affected
    - i have started an lkml thread: http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/12/2/232, but it appears
    that there is no longer any interest in the problems...
  debian/jmm: "IIRC there was some serious flaming about the different disk encryption\
    \ systems,\nI'm not sure whether this has been addressed or how real it is\nPlus,\
    \ cryptoloop is marked DEPRECATED for a long time IIRC\nIt's not included in stock\
    \ 2.4 kernels, but only available in kernel-patch-cryptoloop,\nwhich is only part\
    \ of sid and hasn't been shipped with neither Woody nor Sarge, so\nI'm marking\
    \ all these N/A \nDisabled in 2.6.32-2"
