   A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla_xfer in Linux kernel 2.6.x up to
   2.6.5 and 2.4 up to 2.4.29-rc1 allows local users to read portions of
   kernel memory via a large len argument, which is received as an int but
   cast to a short, which prevents a read loop from filling a buffer.

    Fix was included in 2.6.6. Checked source and 2.6.8 is not vulnerable
    2.4.27 is vulnerable, added fix to SVN. Woody is likely vulnerable

    The referenced patch was applied by Jeff Garzik on 2004-04-16,
    2.6.6 was released on 2004-05-09, so Sarge seems not affected, should
    be double-checked against the source though, but my bandwidth is currently
    too slim to download 2.6.8
    The fix below is for a completely different issue, I've split it out
