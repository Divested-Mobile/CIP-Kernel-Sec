   The shmctl function in Linux 2.6.9 and earlier allows local users to unlock
   the memory of other processes, which could cause sensitive memory to be swapped
   to disk, which could allow it to be read by other users once it has been released.

    It appears that 2.6.8 and earlier are not vulnerable as prior to the
    following patch, local users could not effect lock or unlock

    That is, only 2.6.10 is effected.
