   Race condition in the setsid function in Linux before 2.6.8.1 allows local
   users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly access portions of
   kernel memory, related to TTY changes, locking, and semaphores.

  debian/Alan: |-
    Is it actually needed for 2.4. In the 2.4 case your controlling tty is
    private not thread group so a setsid() can't race because you can't
    setsid in the same thread as is opening current->tty.
  debian/dannf: 'Alan Cox suggested that this is not a 2.4 issue:'
