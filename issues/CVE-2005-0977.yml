   The shmem_nopage function in shmem.c for the tmpfs driver in Linux kernel
   2.6 does not properly verify the address argument, which allows local users
   to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) via an invalid address.

    2.4 does look vulnerable, but the 2.6 fix won't work directly because
    2.4 doesn't have i_size_read().  The 2.6 i_size_read() uses seqlocks,
    which aren't in 2.4, so the port isn't trivial for me.
