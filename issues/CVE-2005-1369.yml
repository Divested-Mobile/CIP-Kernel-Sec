   The (1) it87 and (2) via686a drivers in I2C for Linux 2.6.x before 2.6.11.8,
   and 2.6.12 before 2.6.12-rc2, create the sysfs "alarms" file with write
   permissions, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU
   consumption) by attempting to write to the file, which does not have an
   associated store function.
