description: |2-

   The pkt_ioctl function in the pktcdvd block device ioctl handler (pktcdvd.c)
   in Linux kernel 2.6.12-rc4 and earlier calls the wrong function before
   passing an ioctl to the block device, which crosses security boundaries by
   making kernel address space accessible from user space and allows local users
   to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code, a similar
   vulnerability to CVE-2005-1264.

    (discussing this and a similar problem):
    2.6.8 is only vulnerable to the raw ioctl problem,
    which I believe is CAN-2005-1264.
    (unstable/testing-proposed-updates) and sarge-security
    (testing-security) branches and it should appear in 2.6.8-16 and
    2.6.8-15sarge1 respectively.
    2.4.27 does not appear to be vulnerable to either of these problems.
