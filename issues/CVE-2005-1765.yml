   when running in 32-bit compatibility mode, allows local users to cause
   a denial of service (kernel hang) via crafted arguments.

  debian: I'll mark 2.4 N/A
  debian/dannf: This code was very different in 2.4, and we don't ship 2.4/amd64,
    so
  debian/jmm: I've extracted the patch from the Ubuntu update (CVE-2005-1765.patch)
