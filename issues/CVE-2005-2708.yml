   The search_binary_handler function in exec.c in Linux kernel on 64-bit x86
   architectures does not check a return code for a particular function call when
   virtual memory is low, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
   (panic), as demonstrated by running a process using the bash ulimit -v
   command.
