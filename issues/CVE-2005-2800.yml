   Memory leak in the seq_file implemenetation in the SCSI procfs interface
   (sg.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.13 and earlier allows local users to cause a
   denial of service (memory consumption) via certain repeated reads from the
   /proc/scsi/sg/devices file, which is not properly handled when the next()
   iterator returns NULL or an error.

    seq_file is a 2.6ism, so marking 2.4 as N/A
    There's a trivial test case - can it be reproduce this on 2.4?
