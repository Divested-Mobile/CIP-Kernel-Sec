description: |2-

   Linux kernel before 2.6.13.4, when CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is enabled, uses an
   incorrect function to free names_cache memory, which prevents the memory
   from being tracked by AUDITSYSCALL code and leads to a memory leak that
   allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).

  debian: 2.4 isn't vulnerable because AUDITSYSCALL doesn't exist in 2.4
