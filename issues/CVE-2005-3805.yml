   A locking problem in POSIX timer cleanup handling on exit in Linux kernel
   2.6.10 to 2.6.14, when running on SMP systems, allows local users to cause
   a denial of service (deadlock) involving process CPU timers.

    The referenced patch was actually added in 2.6.14, so I think the vulnerable
    versions listed in the description are wrong.
