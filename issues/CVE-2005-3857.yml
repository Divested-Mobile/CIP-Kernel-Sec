   [PATCH] VFS: local denial-of-service with file leases
   .
   The time_out_leases function in locks.c for Linux kernel before 2.6.15
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel log message
   consumption) by causing a large number of broken leases, which is
   recorded to the log using the printk function.
