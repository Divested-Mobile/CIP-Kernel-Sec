   The nl_fib_input function in fib_frontend.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.15
   does not check for valid lengths of the header and payload, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory reference) via
   malformed fib_lookup netlink messages.

    Well, I don't know how it could be exploited by an unpriveleged user -  dannf> but I don't think we need to worry about it.  The vulnerable function
    wasn't added until after 2.6.12, and is already fixed in 2.6.15.
