   Quoting Greg KH:
   Al just pointed me at an old sysfs patch that went into the tree last
   year that has some potential security problems.  Turns out that if you
   write to a sysfs file exactly PAGE_SIZE worth of data, with no zeros in
   it, there's a good chance you could read off the end of the kernel
   buffer into who knows where.

    and since its's sysfs 2.4 is N/A.

    This was judged non-exploitable by Al Viro, but it's still a local DoS
    2.4 N/A, as it doesn't have sysfs
  debian/troyh: N/A for sarge, it was broken in 2.6.12 - 2.6.17-rc1. 2.6.8 is fine,
