description: |2-

   The Linux kernel before 2.6.16.9 and the FreeBSD kernel, when running on
   AMD64 and other 7th and 8th generation AuthenticAMD processors, only
   save/restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
   exception is pending, which allows one process to determine portions of the
   state of floating point instructions of other processes, which can be
   leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. NOTE:
   this is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent
   with Intel processers in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed
   by the kernels.
