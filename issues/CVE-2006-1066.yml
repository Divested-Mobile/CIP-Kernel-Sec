    Subject: \tkernel-image-2.6.8-ia64 - disable preempt\nDate: \tFri, 25 Mar 2005\
    \ 18:57:59 -0700\n.\nhey security team,\nIts likely that kernel-image-2.6.8-ia64\
    \ (2.6.8-12) will be the version\nthat ships in sarge.  This kernel has CONFIG_PREEMPT\
    \ enabled, which has\nat least one known issue in ptrace code that lets an unpriveleged\n\
    userspace process trigger an oops.  This issue went away upstream by\n2.6.9, but\
    \ its unclear what actually fixed it.  SuSE/RedHat disable\nPREEMPT for ia64 (or\
    \ so I'm told), so they are not affected.  This same\ntest case does _not_ fail\
    \ on x86, which also has PREEMPT enabled for\nsarge.\n.\nThis issue has been known\
    \ for a while, but I waited until after d-i\nRC3 to upload it, since it changes\
    \ the ABI.  This fix is in the 2.6.8-13\nbuild in unstable, but the release team\
    \ is blocking this kernel from\nnormal sarge propagation to keep the kernel udebs\
    \ in sync.\n.\n."

    This is only a config change, so it requires no changes to
    kernel-source-2.6.8, but I'll use the kernel-source version
    for the pending/released tags to match the others.
