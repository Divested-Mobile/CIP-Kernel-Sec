description: "\n [TCP]: Do not use inet->id of global tcp_socket when sending RST.\n\
  \ . \n The problem is in ip_push_pending_frames(), which uses:\n .          if (!df)\
  \ {\n .                  __ip_select_ident(iph, &rt->u.dst, 0);\n .          } else\
  \ {\n .                  iph->id = htons(inet->id++);\n .          }\n .\n instead\
  \ of ip_select_ident().\n .\n Right now I think the code is a nonsense. Most likely,\
  \ I copied it from\n old ip_build_xmit(), where it was really special, we had to\
  \ decide\n whether to generate unique ID when generating the first (well, the last)\n\
  \ fragment.\n .\n In ip_push_pending_frames() it does not make sense, it should\
  \ use plain\n ip_select_ident() instead."

  debian/dannf: troyh gave me a patch for 2.4, so I guess it is affected
  debian/jmm: |-
    2.4 doesn't seem to be affected, but I'd prefer a second look before
    marking it N/A
