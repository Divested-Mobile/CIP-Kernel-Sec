   net/ipv4/af_inet.c in Linux kernel 2.4 does not clear sockaddr_in.sin_zero
   before returning IPv4 socket names from the (1) getsockname, (2) getpeername,
   and (3) accept functions, which allows local users to obtain portions of
   potentially sensitive memory.

  debian: |-
    however we actually coincidentally already fixed 1343 in the
    043_ipsec.diff patch
  debian/dannf: both CVE-2006-1342 & CVE-2006-1343 were fixed by the same patch;
  debian/jmm: getorigdst() requires the fix in 2.6.8, inet_getname() is already fixed
