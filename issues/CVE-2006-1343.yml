   net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c in Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6, and
   possibly net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c in 2.6, does not
   clear sockaddr_in.sin_zero before returning IPv4 socket names from the
   getsockopt function with SO_ORIGINAL_DST, which allows local users to
   obtain portions of potentially sensitive memory.

  debian/dannf: marking ignored for sarge3/2.6 due to ^^
  debian/jmm: It's now fixed upstream in 2.6 as well, let's include it in sarge4
  debian/troyh: This isn't fixed upstream in 2.6 yet, at least not in the same way
    as 2.4
