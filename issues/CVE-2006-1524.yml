description: |2-

   madvise_remove in Linux kernel 2.6.16 up to 2.6.16.6 does not follow
   file and mmap restrictions, which allows local users to bypass IPC
   permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with zeroes,
   aka the MADV_REMOVE vulnerability. NOTE: this description was
   originally written in a way that combined two separate issues. The
   mprotect issue now has a separate name, CVE-2006-2071.
