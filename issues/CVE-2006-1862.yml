   The virtual memory implementation in Linux kernel 2.6.x allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (panic) by running lsof a large number of times in
   a way that produces a heavy system load.

    Yeah, this code is neither in debian's 2.4.27/2.6.8 or 2.6.16 upstream
    I also cannot reproduce on debian's 2.6.8 with the test case given in:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=189031
  debian/jmm: There's some indication that this is RH-specific, needs to be checked
