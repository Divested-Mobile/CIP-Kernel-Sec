   Linux SCTP (lksctp) before 2.6.17 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (infinite recursion and crash) via a packet that contains two or
   more DATA fragments, which causes an skb pointer to refer back to itself when
   the full message is reassembled, leading to infinite recursion in the
   sctp_skb_pull function.
