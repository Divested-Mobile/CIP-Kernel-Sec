   Linux SCTP (lksctp) before 2.6.17 allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (deadlock) via a large number of small messages
   to a receiver application that cannot process the messages quickly
   enough, which leads to "spillover of the receive buffer."

    Seems like an ABI-breaker, the sctp_chunk struct is changed in the
    upstream fix, this issue alone is not worth an ABI bump, a fix will
    be postponed for now
    For Sarge we'll ignore it, as it was only available under CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
    and not suitable for production use anyway
