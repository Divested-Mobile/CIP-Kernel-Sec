   Linux kernel before 2.6.16.21 and 2.6.17, when running on PowerPC, does not
   perform certain required access_ok checks, which allows local users to read
   arbitrary kernel memory on 64-bit systems (signal_64.c) and cause a denial of
   service (crash) and possibly read kernel memory on 32-bit systems
   (signal_32.c).

  debian: if this fix is needed or how to apply it.
  debian/dannf: Code has changed significantly since 2.6.8, its not clear to me
