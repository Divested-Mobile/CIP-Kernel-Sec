   The suid_dumpable support in Linux kernel 2.6.13 up to versions before
   2.6.17.4, and 2.6.16 before 2.6.16.24, allows a local user to cause a denial
   of service (disk consumption) and possibly gain privileges via the
   PR_SET_DUMPABLE argument of the prctl function and a program that causes a
   core dump file to be created in a directory for which the user does not have
   permissions.
