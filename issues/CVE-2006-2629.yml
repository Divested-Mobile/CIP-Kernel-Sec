   Race condition in Linux kernel 2.6.15 to 2.6.17, when running on SMP
   platforms, allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by
   creating and exiting a large number of tasks, then accessing the /proc
   entry of a task that is exiting, which causes memory corruption that
   leads to a failure in the prune_dcache function or a BUG_ON error in
   include/linux/list.h.
