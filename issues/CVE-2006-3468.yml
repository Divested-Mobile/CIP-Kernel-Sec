description: "\n Linux kernel 2.6.x, when using both NFS and EXT3, allows remote\n\
  \ attackers to cause a denial of service (file system panic) via a\n crafted UDP\
  \ packet with a V2 lookup procedure that specifies a bad\n file handle (inode number),\
  \ which triggers an error and causes an\n exported directory to be remounted read-only. "
