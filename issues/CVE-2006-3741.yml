description: |2-

   The perfmonctl system call (sys_perfmonctl) in Linux kernel 2.4.x and
   2.6 before 2.6.18, when running on Itanium systems, does not properly
   track the reference count for file descriptors, which allows local
   users to cause a denial of service (file descriptor consumption).

  debian/dannf: I don't think 2.4 is affected - there are no existing calls to fput
