   The kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, when running on SMP
   systems, allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock)
   by running the shmat function on an shm at the same time that shmctl
   is removing that shm (IPC_RMID), which prevents a spinlock from being
   unlocked.

    not reproducible on sarge/2.6.8/amd64/4xCPU, issue supposedly
    doesn't affect upstream 2.4, only in RH 2.4 due to 2.5 backport
