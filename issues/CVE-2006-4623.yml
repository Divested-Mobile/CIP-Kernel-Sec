   The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) decapsulation
   component in dvb-core/dvb_net.c in the dvb driver in the Linux kernel
   2.6.17.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
   via an SNDU length of 0 in a ULE packet.

    invalid ULE packets, it should be fixed to not crash upon
    receiving one.
    that conflicts with the one provided by the original reporter (which
    went into 2.6.17.y). I asked the original reporter if that patch also
    fixed the issue. Ang Way replied:
    "Yes, it is fixed in 2.6.18 and later even though the patch is
    different. Their fix is more elegant."
    So, marking etch N/A
  debian/dannf: I noticed that a different, and much larger patch went into 2.6.18
  debian/mpitt: Questionable -- rather than fixing the kernel to not send out
