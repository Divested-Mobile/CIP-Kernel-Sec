   The __block_prepare_write function in fs/buffer.c for Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.13
   does not properly clear buffers during certain error conditions, which allows local
   users to read portions of files that have been unlinked.

    I don't think 2.4 is affected because the BH_New bit is not
    cleared after get_block returns - marking 2.4.27 N/A
