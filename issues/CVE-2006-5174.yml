description: "\n The copy_from_user function in the uaccess code in Linux kernel 2.6\n\
  \ before 2.6.19-rc1, when running on s390, does not properly clear a\n kernel buffer,\
  \ which allows local user space programs to read\n portions of kernel memory by\
  \ \"appending to a file from a bad\n address,\" which triggers a fault that prevents\
  \ the unused memory from\n being cleared in the kernel buffer. "
