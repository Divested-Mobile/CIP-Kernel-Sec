   The sys_[gs]et_robust_list() syscalls were wired up on PowerPC but
   didn't work correctly because futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() wasn't
   implemented.  Implement it, based on __cmpxchg_u32().

    But, as this is a powerpc specific CVE, I'll mark Debian as ok
  debian/dannf: 'Looks like sparc is also vulnerable in 2.6.18, see:'
