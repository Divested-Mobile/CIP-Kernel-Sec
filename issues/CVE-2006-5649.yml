   The alignment exception used to only check the exception table for
   -EFAULT, not for other errors. That opens an oops window if we can
   coerce the kernel into getting an alignment exception for other
   reasons in what would normally be a user-protected accessor, which
   can be done via some of the futex ops. This fixes it by always
   checking the exception tables.
