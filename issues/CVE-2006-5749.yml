   The isdn_ppp_ccp_reset_alloc_state function in
   drivers/isdn/isdn_ppp.c in the Linux 2.4 kernel before 2.4.34-rc4
   does not call the init_timer function for the ISDN PPP CCP reset
   state timer, which has unknown attack vectors and results in a system
   crash.

    According to Marcel Holtmann, 2.4 and 2.6 < 2.6.13 are not vulnerable.
    Indeed, in 2.4.27 & 2.6.8, init_timer() just sets timer->base to NULL,
    so the memset() is sufficient to avoid this crash.
    However, in 2.6.8 init_timer() also sets a magic number. add_timer()
    will call __mod_timer(), which calls check_timer(), which will cause
    the kernel to whine if this magic number is not set. I don't think this
    will cause a crash, so I'm considering a non-security issue
