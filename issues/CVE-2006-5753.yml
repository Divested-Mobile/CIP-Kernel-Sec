   The listxattr syscall can corrupt user space under certain
   circumstances. The problem seems to be related to signed/unsigned
   conversion during size promotion. The function return_EIO returns an
   int but its used as a ssize_t with a comparison to 0. This causes the
   range check to fail and copy_to_user copies way too much.
   The command line "fsfuzz iso9660" can easily reproduce this behavior.
