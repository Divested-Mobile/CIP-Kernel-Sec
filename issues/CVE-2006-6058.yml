   The minix filesystem code in Linux kernel 2.6.x up to 2.6.18, and possibly
   other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (hang) via a
   malformed minix file stream that triggers an infinite loop in the minix_bmap
   function. NOTE: this issue might be due to an integer overflow or signedness
   error.

  debian: |-
    and don't know if there's an upstream fix
    set user-mountable media's filesystem type to 'auto' in fstab,
    allowing them to use any fs on the system. I could see this being
    used to annoy sysadmins, e.g., in a university lab setting
  debian/dannf: |-
    ignored for sarge for now - only applies under very rare circumstances
    Though I agree its minor, I suspect its not so rare that admins
  debian/jmm: We can ignore this, it has no practical ramifications
fixed-by:
  mainline: [f44ec6f3f89889a469773b1fd894f8fcc07c29cf]
