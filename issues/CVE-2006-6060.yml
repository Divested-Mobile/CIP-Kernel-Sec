   The NTFS filesystem code in Linux kernel 2.6.x up to 2.6.18, and possibly
   other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU
   consumption) via a malformed NTFS file stream that triggers an infinite loop
   in the __find_get_block_slow function.

    fixed by patch for CVE-2006-5757 since the bug is in the common
    __find_get_block_slow() function.
    it didn't cause an infinite loop, the system did lock up hard
    backported and applied it will print:
    NTFS: Problem with runlist in extended record
    ... and then oops.
    So, I'm guessing this patch makes things better, but I don't think
    its worth the risk of applying it unless the other oops gets fixed
    as well.
    patched 2.4.36 prints

    reproducer at http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-19-11-2006.html
    I mounted the reproducer fs on an ia64/2.4.27 system and though
    The reproducer causes i386/2.4.36 to oops; but if this patch is
    Unpatched 2.4.27 oopses and prints the same runlist message that
