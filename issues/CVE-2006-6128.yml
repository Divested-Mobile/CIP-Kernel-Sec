   versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service via a malformed
   ReiserFS file system that triggers memory corruption when a sync is performed.

    maybe fedora-specific. Indeed, I cannot reproduce w/ the MOKB fs
    any of the Debian kernels
  debian/dannf: |-
    low impact; no known upstream fix
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=250625 suggests this
  debian/jmm: |-
    ignored, only exploitable with manipulated fs images, for which mount
    privs are needed
