   The NFS client implementation in the kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
   3, when a filesystem is mounted with the noacl option, checks permissions for
   the open system call via vfs_permission (mode bits) data rather than an NFS
   ACCESS call to the server, which allows local client processes to obtain a
   false success status from open calls that the server would deny, and possibly
   obtain sensitive information about file permissions on the server, as
   demonstrated in a root_squash environment. NOTE: it is uncertain whether any
   scenarios involving this issue cross privilege boundaries.
