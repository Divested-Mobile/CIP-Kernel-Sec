   binaries by using the interpreter (PT_INTERP) functionality and triggering
   a core dump, a variant of CVE-2004-1073.

  debian: |-
    for a reproducer in 2007.02. I sent Willy an e-mail on 2008.02.06
    to see if he ever heard back. Until then, I'll assume 2.4 is ok.
  debian/dannf: Red Hat's 2.4 isn't vulnerable; Willy Tarreau asked the reporter
