   Race condition in the tee (sys_tee) system call in the Linux kernel 2.6.17 through
   2.6.17.6 might allow local users to cause a denial of service (system crash), obtain
   sensitive information (kernel memory contents), or gain privileges via unspecified
   vectors related to a potentially dropped ipipe lock during a race between two pipe
   readers.
