   The individual fragments of a packet reassembled by conntrack have
   the conntrack reference from the reassembled packet attached, but
   nfctinfo is not copied. This leaves it initialized to 0, which
   unfortunately is the value of IP_CT_ESTABLISHED.
   The result is that all IPv6 fragments are tracked as ESTABLISHED,
   allowing them to bypass a usual ruleset which accepts ESTABLISHED
   packets early.
