   The DCCP support in the do_dccp_getsockopt function in net/dccp/proto.c in
   Linux kernel 2.6.20 and later does not verify the upper bounds of the optlen
   value, which allows local users running on certain architectures to read
   kernel memory or cause a denial of service (oops), a related issue to CVE-2007-1730
