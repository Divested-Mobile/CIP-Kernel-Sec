   The IPv6 protocol allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via
   crafted IPv6 type 0 route headers (IPV6_RTHDR_TYPE_0) that create network
   amplification between two routers.

    <vlad> dannf: is someone including commits 010831ab8436dfd9304b203467566fb6b135c24f and 9d08f139275450f9366d85ba09b9a2e09bb33766 (IPv6 routing header changes) in the debian kernel?
    ...
    <dannf> vlad: right, but (010831ab8436dfd9304b203467566fb6b135c24f) is security, so it'll be included in etch if necessary
    <dannf> s/necessary/affected/
    <vlad> dannf: you need the second one I listed as well, since the first one has a bug in it.
    <dannf> vlad: oh, ok - thx
    <vlad> dannf: although for the purposes of 2.6.18, the second one might be a no-op and the first one might need to be modified a bit.

    Some info from Vlad Yasevich:
    functions are different, but 2.4 code looks similar
    My 2.4 backport attempt causes a crash at boot time, ignoring for now
  debian/jmm: Contacted Willy
