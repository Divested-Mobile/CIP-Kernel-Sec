   The _udp_lib_get_port function in net/ipv4/udp.c in Linux kernel 2.6.21 and
   earlier does not prevent a bind to a port with a local address when there is
   already a bind to that port with a wildcard local address, which might allow
   local users to intercept local traffic for daemons or other applications.
