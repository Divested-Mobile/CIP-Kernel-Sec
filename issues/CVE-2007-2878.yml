   The VFAT compat ioctls in the Linux kernel before 2.6.21.2, when run
   on a 64-bit system, allow local users to corrupt a kernel_dirent struct
   and cause a denial of service (system crash) via unknown vectors.

    reproduced in etch using reproducer provided in the changeset
    backporting the fix only proved hazardous as there was some recent
    restructuring - i've elected to backport that as well
    (fat-move-ioctl-compat-code.patch)
    marking sarge kernels as N/A because amd64 wasn't officially supported
    and the backport is non-trivial (read: risk outweighs benefit)
    reverted from etch-security branch in r9295 due to ABI change
