   Stack-based buffer overflow in the random number generator (RNG)
   implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 might allow local root
   users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by setting the
   default wakeup threshold to a value greater than the output pool size,
   which triggers writing random numbers to the stack by the pool transfer
   function involving "bound check ordering". NOTE: this issue might only
   cross privilege boundaries in environments that have granular assignment
   of privileges for root.

    Vulnerable code not present in 2.4.27
    2.6.8 is affected, but since we don't have full SE Linux support in
    Sarge, I don't believe this is an issue, which needs to be fixed
