   The Linux kernel before 2.6.23-rc1 checks the wrong global variable
   for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
   spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
   signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i in
   a SetupAndX request.
