   The (1) aac_cfg_open and (2) aac_compat_ioctl functions in the SCSI
   layer ioctl path in aacraid in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23-rc2 do
   not check permissions for ioctls, which might allow local users to
   cause a denial of service or gain privileges.

  debian/jmm: 2.4.27 code is quite different, but appears vulnerable as well
