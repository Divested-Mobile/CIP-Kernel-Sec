   *REJECTED*
   Buffer overflow in the (1) sysfs_show_available_clocksources and (2)
   sysfs_show_current_clocksources functions in Linux kernel 2.6.23 and earlier
   might allow local users to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary
   code via crafted clock source names.

comments:
  debian/kees: this is not actually an exploitable security issue. there is no way
    to add clock sources that could trigger the overflow.
