   Linux kernel 2.6.23 allows local users to create low pages in virtual userspace
   memory and bypass mmap_min_addr protection via a crafted executable file that calls
   the do_brk function.

  debian/kees: ecaf18c15aac8bb9bed7b7aa0e382fe252e275d5 (however, I think this only
    applied to 2.6.23 or newer -- security_file_mmap didn't take addresses until then)
