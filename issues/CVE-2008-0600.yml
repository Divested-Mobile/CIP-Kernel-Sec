   The vmsplice_to_pipe function in Linux kernel 2.6.17 through 2.6.24.1
   does not validate a certain userspace pointer before dereference, which
   allows local users to gain root privileges via crafted arguments in
   a vmsplice system call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-0009
   and CVE-2008-0010.
