description: |2-

   The asn1 implementation in (a) the Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.36.6 and 2.6
   before 2.6.25.5, as used in the cifs and ip_nat_snmp_basic modules; and (b)
   the gxsnmp package; does not properly validate length values during
   decoding of ASN.1 BER data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) a length greater than
   the working buffer, which can lead to an unspecified overflow; (2) an oid
   length of zero, which can lead to an off-by-one error; or (3) an indefinite
   length for a primitive encoding.
