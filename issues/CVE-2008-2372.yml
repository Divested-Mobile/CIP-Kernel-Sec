  debian/jmm: ZERO_PAGE was removed in 2.6.24 with commit 557ed1fa2620dc119adb86b34c614e152a629a80
  ubuntu/kees: |-
    is this even security-relevant?
    linux-2.6: 89f5b7da2a6bad2e84670422ab8192382a5aeb9f
    and also: 672ca28e300c17bf8d792a2a7a8631193e580c74 (vmware breakage)
    this is being fixed via -proposed -20 abi (which will likely be -22 in the end)
