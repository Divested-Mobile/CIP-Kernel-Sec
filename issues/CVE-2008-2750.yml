description: |2-

   The pppol2tp_recvmsg function in drivers/net/pppol2tp.c in the Linux
   kernel 2.6 before 2.6.26-rc6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (kernel heap memory corruption and system crash) and possibly
   have unspecified other impact via a crafted PPPOL2TP packet that results
   in a large value for a certain length variable.
