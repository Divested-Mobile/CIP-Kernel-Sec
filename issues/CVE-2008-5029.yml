   The __scm_destroy function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel
   2.6.27.4, 2.6.26, and earlier makes indirect recursive calls to itself
   through calls to the fput function, which allows local users to cause
   a denial of service (panic) via vectors related to sending an
   SCM_RIGHTS message through a UNIX domain socket and closing file
   descriptors.
