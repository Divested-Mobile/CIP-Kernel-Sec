description: "\n The parisc_show_stack function in arch/parisc/kernel/traps.c in the\
  \ Linux\n kernel before 2.6.28-rc7 on PA-RISC allows local users to cause a denial\
  \ of\n service (system crash) via vectors associated with an attempt to unwind a\n\
  \ stack that contains userspace addresses. "

comments:
  ubuntu/smb: The call do dump_stack was not added before v2.6.25-rc6. So the resulting
    panic will not happen.
