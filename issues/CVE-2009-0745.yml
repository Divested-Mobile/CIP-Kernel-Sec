description: "\n The ext4_group_add function in fs/ext4/resize.c in the Linux\n kernel\
  \ 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 does\n not properly initialize\
  \ the group descriptor during a resize\n (aka resize2fs) operation, which might\
  \ allow local users to\n cause a denial of service (OOPS) by arranging for crafted\n\
  \ values to be present in available memory. "

    Yeah, certainly unimportant, but I'll apply anyway since it
    applies trivially

    ext4 is marked as experimental and the vulnerability fairly
    obscure, I don't think we should spend energy on this. Dann,
    if you don't object I'll mark this as "unimportant" in the
    security tracker
