description: "\n The ext4_isize function in fs/ext4/ext4.h in the Linux kernel\n 2.6.27\
  \ before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 uses the\n i_size_high structure member\
  \ during operations on arbitrary\n types of files, which allows local users to cause\
  \ a denial of\n service (CPU consumption and error-message flood) by\n attempting\
  \ to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem. "

  debian/jmm: |-
    ext4 is marked as experimental and the vulnerability fairly
    obscure, I don't think we should spend energy on this. Dann,
    if you don't object I'll mark this as "unimportant" in the
    security tracker
