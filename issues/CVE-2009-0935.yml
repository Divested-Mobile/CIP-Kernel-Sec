description: "\n The inotify_read function in the Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.29-rc3\n\
  \ allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a read\n with an invalid\
  \ address to an inotify instance, which causes the\n device's event list mutex to\
  \ be unlocked twice and prevents proper\n synchronization of a data structure for\
  \ the inotify instance. "
