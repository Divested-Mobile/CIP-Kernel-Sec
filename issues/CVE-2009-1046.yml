description: "\n The console selection feature in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 before\n\
  \ 2.6.28.4, 2.6.25, and possibly earlier versions, when the UTF-8\n console is used,\
  \ allows physically proximate attackers to cause\n a denial of service (memory corruption)\
  \ by selecting a small\n number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters, which triggers an \"\
  an\n off-by-two memory error.\" NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue\n crosses\
  \ privilege boundaries. "
