description: "\n The OpenVZ Linux kernel team has found deadlock between ptrace and\
  \ \n coredump code. It affects 2.6.18 but does not affect the upstream kernel.\n\
  \ .\n \"ptrace_start() spins waiting for child->state == \n TASK_TRACED/TASK_STOPPED.\
  \ If we race with the coredumping, we have to \n wait until it completes.\n .\n\
  \ If the tracer participates in coredumping too, we deadlock. \n do_coredump() waits\
  \ for tracer to exit and report \n complete(mm->core_startup_done), the tracer spins\
  \ in an endless loop.\n .\n Change ptrace_start() to abort if child->mm->core_waiters\
  \ != 0.\""

  debian: "I can't find the ptrace_start() code in any of the debian kernels, so i\
    \ \nbelieve this to be a redhat-specific issue"
