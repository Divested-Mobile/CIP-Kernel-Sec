description: "\n The Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc7 does not properly prevent mmap\
  \ operations that \n target page zero and other low memory addresses, which allows\
  \ local users to gain \n privileges by exploiting NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities,\
  \ related to (1) \n the default configuration of the allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean\
  \ in SELinux on \n Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, (2) an error that causes \n\
  \ allow_unconfined_mmap_low to be ignored in the unconfined_t domain, (3) lack of\
  \ a \n requirement for the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability for these mmap operations, and\
  \ (4) \n interaction between the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and certain\
  \ application \n programs."
