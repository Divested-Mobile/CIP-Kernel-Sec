   parisc: isa-eeprom missing lower bound check
   .
   loff_t is a signed type. If userspace passes a negative ppos, the
   "count" range check is weakened. If ppos is negative, the readb() later
   in the function will poke in random memory. Only affects if you are
   using a PA-RISC kernel with CONFIG_EISA set.
