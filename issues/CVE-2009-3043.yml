description: "\n The tty ldisc code was rewritten to use proper reference counts (commits\
  \ \n 65b770468e98 and cbe9352fa08f) in order to avoid a race with hangup, but \n\
  \ it also introduced another bug that can result in various problems such \n as\
  \ a NULL pointer dereference in run_timer_softirq() or a BUG() in \n worker_thread.\
  \ More info in the patch."
