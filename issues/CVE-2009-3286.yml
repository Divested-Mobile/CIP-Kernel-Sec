description: "\n There is an issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 that with enough \n\
  \ attempts, it is possible for a lingering file from a failed create that \n is\
  \ world-writable but only setuid execute as the user who is attempting \n these\
  \ creates. Fortunately, root is not susceptible to this bug, so a \n setuid root\
  \ file should not be possible. It might be possible to exploit \n this to gain access\
  \ as another user though."
