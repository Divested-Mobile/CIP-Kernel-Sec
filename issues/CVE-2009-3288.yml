   The sg_build_indirect function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in Linux kernel
   2.6.28-rc1 through 2.6.31-rc8 uses an incorrect variable when
   accessing an array, which allows local users to cause a denial of
   service (kernel OOPS and NULL pointer dereference), as demonstrated by
   using xcdroast to duplicate a CD. Â NOTE: this is only exploitable by
   users who can open the cdrom device.
