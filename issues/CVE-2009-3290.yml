description: "\n \"So far unprivileged guest callers running in ring 3 can issue,\
  \ e.g., \n MMU hypercalls. Normally, such callers cannot provide any hand-crafted\
  \ \n MMU command structure as it has to be passed by its physical address, \n but\
  \ they can still crash the guest kernel by passing random addresses.\n .\n To close\
  \ the hole, this patch considers hypercalls valid only if issued \n from guest ring\
  \ 0. This may still be relaxed on a per-hypercall base in \n the future once required.\"\
  \n .\n This was introduced in v2.6.25-rc1, and fixed in 2.6.31\n jmm> The oss-security\
  \ posting is wrong, this was fixed in 2.6.31-1"
