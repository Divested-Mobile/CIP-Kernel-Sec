description: "\n a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following\n\
  \ functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and\n pipe_rdwr_open().\
  \ When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could\n be released by other\
  \ processes before it is used to update the pipe's reader\n and writer counters.\
  \ This could lead to a local denial of service or \n privilege escalation."

  debian: "Brad Spengler *claims* to have already developed a working exploit.  Since\n\
    his previous work has been effective, it is probably true.  Hence, this \nshould\
    \ be treated with high urgency.\n- May be not be exploitable on debian due to\
    \ mmap_min_addr protections?"
