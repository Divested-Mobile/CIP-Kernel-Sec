   "On setting up the callback to the client, we attempt to use the same
   authentication flavor the client did.  We find an rpc cred to use by
   calling rpcauth_lookup_credcache(), which assumes that the given
   authentication flavor has a credentials cache.  However, this is not
   required to be true--in particular, auth_null does not use one.
   Instead, we should call the auth's lookup_cred() method.
   .
   Without this, a client attempting to mount using nfsv4 and auth_null
   triggers a null dereference."
   .
   The code was introduced in upstream commit 3cef9ab2 (v2.6.31-rc1),
   fixed in 886e3b7f (v2.6.32-rc1), and was later replaced by 80fc015b in
   the same version.
