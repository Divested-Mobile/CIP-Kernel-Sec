  debian: kvm support introduced in 2.6.25
  debian/jmm: |-
    The 2.6.26 has the code in a different file, in which is was still
    guarded for APIC. I've send Avi an email and he confirmed that
    older kernels are not affected
fixed-by:
  mainline: [88c808fd42b53a7e01a2ac3253ef31fef74cb5af, c3443b436a0767cbc0d4ab405f8fa13fb34bd56c]
