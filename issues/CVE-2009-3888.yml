description: "\n Don't pass NULL pointers to fput() in the error handling paths of\
  \ the\n NOMMU do_mmap_pgoff() as it can't handle it.\n .\n The following can be\
  \ used as a test program:\n int main() { static long long a[1024 * 1024 * 20] =\
  \ { 0 }; return a;}\n .\n Without the patch, the code oopses in atomic_long_dec_and_test()\
  \ as\n called by fput() after the kernel complains that it can't allocate\n that\
  \ big a chunk of memory. Â With the patch, the kernel just complains \n about the\
  \ allocation size and then the program segfaults during execve() \n as execve()\
  \ can't complete the allocation of all the new ELF program \n segments."
