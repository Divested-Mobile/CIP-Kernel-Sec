    The kernel.org version is quite different, though. Maybe it's only exploitable\
    \ in \ncombination with the plethora of KVM patches added by Red Hat?"
  ubuntu/kees: |-
    guest can crash host
    but a fix was included for Lucid anyway?
  ubuntu/smb: |-
    Looking at the redhat bugzilla it says: "If emulator is tricked into
    emulating mov to/from DR instruction it causes NULL pointer dereference
    on VMX since kvm_x86_ops->(set|get)_dr are not initialized."
    Now before v2.6.36-rc1 KVM has no ops->(set|get)_dr but calls the
    function directly. So that Oops cannot happen.
    It was by upstream. Now pulled that change back to Hardy and Karmic.
    I believe the reference in the backport is pointing to upstream
    commit 020df0794f5764e742feaa718be88b8f1b4ce04f which was part of
    2.6.35-rc1
