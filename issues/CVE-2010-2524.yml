     sbeattie> according to oss-security discussion, git commit 6103335de8afa5d780dcd512abe85c696af7b040
     introduced the problem, so 2.6.25-rc1 onwards.
     smb> Jaunty *may* be affected, but the problem is that there is no infra-
     smb> structure for thread credentials, so even if it is possible to back-
     smb> port the whole thing it would be completely different and prone to
     smb> be incorrect. That together with the fact that Jaunty is EOL more or
     smb> less I don't think we should put in much effort there.
