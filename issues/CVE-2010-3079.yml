description: "\n kernel/trace/ftrace.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35.5, when debugfs\
  \ is enabled,\n does not properly handle interaction between mutex possession and\
  \ llseek operations,\n which allows local users to cause a denial of service (outage\
  \ of all function tracing\n files) via an lseek call on a file descriptor associated\
  \ with the set_ftrace_filter file. "
