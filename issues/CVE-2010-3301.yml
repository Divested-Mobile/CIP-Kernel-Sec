    only exploitable on x86_64, regression of CVE-2007-4573
    was originally fixed in 2.6.22, but regressed after this commit:
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.35.y.git;a=commitdiff;h=d4d67150165df8bf1cc05e532f6efca96f907cab
    it was later discovered that the Xen kernels (linux-ec2) needed an additional patch.
