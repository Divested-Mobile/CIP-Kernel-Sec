    The vulnerability described by CVE-2010-3699 probably exists, but
     I've not been able to reproduce it. It likely requires more block and
     network devices then I have at my disposal. Checked out
     http://xenbits.xensource.com/linux-2.6.18-xen.hg and compared. Not all of
     the original upstream patch was appropriate since it caused a regression
     with udev.
