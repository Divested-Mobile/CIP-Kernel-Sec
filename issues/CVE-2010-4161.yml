  debian/jmm: "The referenced patch ended up in 2.6.26.6, which was\npulled into the\
    \ Lenny package. I find the statement in\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=652534#c4\n\
    a bit confusing, why should RHEL6 have backported \nfda9ef5d, the commit is from\
    \ 2006?\nMarking 2.6.27 as fixed upstream, since it includes\n93821778"
