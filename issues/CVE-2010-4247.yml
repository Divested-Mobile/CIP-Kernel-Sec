    xen-3.1 has linux-2.6-xen-sparse/drivers/xen/blkback/blkback.c, but
     xen-3.2 and xen-3.3 do not
    marking dapper task as ignored since we no longer support xen
     userspace on Dapper anyway

    My feeling is that xen-3.1 has code affected, but does not package
    that up. That would make only Hardy kernel code truely affected.
    Oneiric not-affected for now (not containing blkback) and when we
    move to upstream v3.0 is is fixed there.
