    Note from Neil Horman in the RH bugtracker:
    Note that9915672d41273f5b77f1b3c29b391ffb7732b84b is only part of the solution.
    We also need bba14de98753cb6599a2dae0e520714b2153522d from net-next.

    fyi, i have the last two queued up in my tree; it has an
    abi change which i need to address properly before commit.
    tests show this was sufficient to avoid OOM'ing w/ the reproducer in
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/23/395.
    The reproducer associated with 25888e303
    (https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/25/8) is different; and has
    different symptoms (unkillable process vs. OOM) - perhaps it should
    have a different CVE?
    I've added CVE-2010-af_unix-recursion to track that issue.

    Looks like the following commits are needed from Linus git?

    2.6.32.40 is missing bba14, it was added in 2.6.32.47

    dapper_linux-source-2.6.15 was marked as pending, but not included
