description: 'Memory leak in drivers/media/video/videobuf-core.c in the videobuf subsystem
  in the Linux kernel 2.6.x through 4.x allows local users to cause a denial of service
  (memory consumption) by leveraging /dev/video access for a series of mmap calls
  that require new allocations, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-6761.  NOTE:
  as of 2016-06-18, this affects only 11 drivers that have not been updated to use
  videobuf2 instead of videobuf.'

    ignoring, as there are no details about what needs fixing,
      and it looks like major portions got rewritten in 2011, and has
      likely been addressed.
