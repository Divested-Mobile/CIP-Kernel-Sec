    We won't fix this for Squeeze. This only applies to non-standard setups with fine
    grained security capability models, and an attacker can only load modules from
    /lib/modules, which is only writable with root privs
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: &id001 ['version:debian/2.6.38-1']
  debian/stretch-security: *id001
