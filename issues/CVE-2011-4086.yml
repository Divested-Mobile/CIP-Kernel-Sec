  ubuntu/apw: |-
    This is sitting in Ted Ts'o's dev tree presumably waiting on the 3.4
    merge window, the issue is masked from v3.2 onwards by other commits.
    The commit itself is marked for stable and for now I suspect we should
    wait for it.  We have no stable commit id as yet, see:
    jbd2: clear BH_Delay & BH_Unwritten in journal_unmap_buffer
    this has now appeared upstream (see below)
