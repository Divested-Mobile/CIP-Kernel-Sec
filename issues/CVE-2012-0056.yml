  ubuntu/apw: |-
    as the proposed fix actually changes behaviour significantly and the
    functionality is very new and thus less likely to be needed it has been
    decided to revert 198214a for oneiric (the only release affected) and
    monitor it in precise for release.
  ubuntu/mdeslaur: RH says introduced by 198214a7ee, needs checking.
