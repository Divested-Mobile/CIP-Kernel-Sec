    Real fix seems to be:
    http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/293827/

    Contacted RH security team. It's this patch, which hasn't been
    merged in mainline yet as of 2013-04-30:
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1493571/
    Different patch, also not merged upstream:
    https://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=redpatch.git;a=commit;h=c7b6a0a1d8d636852be130fa15fa8be10d4704e8

    this is claimed fixed by RedHat but I cannot find the fix anywhere, the
    only reference I did find to the CVE in Fedora implies they have miss
    tagged the fix for CVE-2012-2373 as 2372:
    http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.extras.cvs/775892
    note the patch is the x86 pmd patch.
    needs-triage back to -security for lack of a clear direction on a fix (per
    irc discussions)
    Looking at the RHEL kernels it appears that this is the fix, though it
    is not upstream as yet:
