  ubuntu/apw: |-
    the spender sidechannel patch above may not be generally applicable
    but I include it for completeness.
  ubuntu/henrix: |-
    commit b0de59b5733d18b0d1974a060860a8b5c1b36a2e is not sufficient to
    fix the CVE because an application doesn't have to read atime/mtime
    (as is the case for the PoC).  The 2 additional commits fix a
    regression and mark the shared ptmx node as un-notifiable (which will
    cause additional problems to backport them to Lucid, as it doesn't have
    this feature)
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: &id001 ['version:debian/3.8.12-1']
  debian/stretch-security: *id001
