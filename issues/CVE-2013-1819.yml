comments:
  debian: |-
    The backported fix in 3.7.y caused a regression and was reverted,
    so be careful with backporting this.
  ubuntu/henrix: |-
    This CVE has minor impact as it requires root privileges to mount a
    corrupted image.  Also, it is too risky to backport the fix to older
    kernels (Precise, in this case).
  ubuntu/jjohansen: |-
    precise_linux and precise_linux-lts-quantal ignored (was in
     USN-1968-1/3.2.0-54.82 reverted minor priority CVE with high risk of
     regression in backport)
    precise_linux-armadaxp ignored due to high risk of regression in
     backport
