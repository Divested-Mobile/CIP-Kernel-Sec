    41c21e351e79004dbb4efa4bc14a53a7e0af38c5 is additional hardening;
     it does not on its own fix this CVE, nor will it get its own CVE number,
     though it is useful enough to be included in an update. Andy recommended
     applying in conjunction with 83f1b4ba917db5dc5a061a44b3403ddb6e783494.
