    Caused by RHEL backport

  ubuntu/henrix: |-
    This is a Red Hat specific bug introduced by their CVE-2012-3552
    fix.  This was a backport of upstream
    f6d8bd051c391c1c0458a30b2a7abcd939329259.  Only Lucid contains a
    backport of this commit (all the other Ubuntu kernels include the
    upstream commit) and Lucid backport is quite different from RH
    one (it was picked from upstream 3.2, which picked it from
    Debian).
  ubuntu/seth-arnold: |-
    Unprivileged user kernel crash demonstrated; code execution
     neither confirmed nor denied.
