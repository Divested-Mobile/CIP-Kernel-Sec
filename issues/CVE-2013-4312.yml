    712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593 according to the commit
    message mitigated the issue.
    There is a second commit [759c01142a5d0f364a462346168a56de28a80f52] to
    mitigate CVE-2013-4312, but this is slightly more involving. Ben
    suggested to wait before starting to backport this as well and look
    for possible regressions/problems.
