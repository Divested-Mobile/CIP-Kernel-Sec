    So far as I can see, this was introduced by commit e34ecee2ae79
    "aio: Fix a trinity splat" and fixed by commit d558023207e0, both
    of which went into 3.13-rc3 and 3.12.4.  So no releases appear to
    be affected and this CVE is entirely bogus.
    There was another regression caused by "aio: Fix a trinity splat",
    fixed by commit 200067a3f3e7 "aio: fix kioctx leak ..."
