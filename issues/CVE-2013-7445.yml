  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  Ubuntu-sbeattie: no progress by upstream on fixing this.
ignore:
  linux-3.16.y: Fix is likely to be too big and risky to backport
  linux-3.2.y: Fix is likely to be too big and risky to backport
