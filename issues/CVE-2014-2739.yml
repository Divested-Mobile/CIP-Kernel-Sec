    From oss-sec:
    Linux kernel built with the InfiniBand communication link(CONFIG_INFINIBAND)
    along with the support for Remote Direct Memory Access(RDMA) over Convered
    Ethernet(RoCE), is vulnerable to a crash caused by invalid memory access.
    It occurs while trying to resolve RoCE L2 address on the server side.
    A remote unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel,
    resulting in DoS.

    android kernels (goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are not
     supported on the Ubuntu Touch 13.10 preview kernels
