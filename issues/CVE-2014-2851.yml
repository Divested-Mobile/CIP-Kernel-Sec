  debian: 'raphael: Appears to have been introduced with the support for IPPROTO_ICMP
    in 3.0-rc1'
  debian/bwh: |-
    Bug is in permission checks for creating ping sockets, so is exploitable
    even though the default permissions prevent them being created.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are not
     supported on the Ubuntu Touch 13.10 preview kernels
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    android init writes a valid group range to
     /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range which results in all unprivileged users
     being allowed to open restricted ICMP sockets and trigger this bug
