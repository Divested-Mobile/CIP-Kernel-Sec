    Martin Schwidefsky says this was introduced by commit fa968ee215c0
    ("s390/signal: set correct address space control").  It added the
    ASC (Address Space Control) processor status bits to those that
    must be restored on return from signals, but as a result they can
    also be set arbitrarily by ptrace.  This opens a vulnerability if
    the kernel parameter user_mode=primary is used.  Commit e258d719ff28
    ("s390/uaccess: always run the kernel in home space") made that
    the default (I think).
