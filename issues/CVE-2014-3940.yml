description: missing check during hugepage migration
comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    Hugepage migration was extended in 3.12 and it's not clear that
    there is a security impact for older versions.  The upstream commit
    indicates that is the earliest stable branch it should be backported
    to.  But it should be harmless to add the pte_present() check to
    older versions anyway.

  debian/stretch-security: *id001
