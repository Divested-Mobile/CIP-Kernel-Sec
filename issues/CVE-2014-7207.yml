  debian/bwh: |-
    Bug was introduced in 3.2.63 (and 3.4.101) by the backport of
    commit 73f156a6e8c1 ("inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count") which
    assumes ipv6_select_ident() is called with a non-null struct
    rt6_info pointer.  That was not true as they were missing commit
    916e4cf46d02 ("ipv6: reuse ip6_frag_id from ip6_ufo_append_data").
    Neither the upstream kernel nor any other stable branch had this
    bug.
