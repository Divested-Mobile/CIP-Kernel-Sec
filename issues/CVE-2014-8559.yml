  debian: |-
    According to https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/25/179 this was introduced
    by "fs: dcache avoid starvation in dcache multi-step operations", i.e.
    commit 58db63d08679 in 2.6.38-rc1.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.04 preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
    "See vfs.git#experimental-d_walk - the first commit there moves
     d_rcu from d_child to d_alias, the second is basically "skip the killed
     siblings rather than restarting the tree walk"
