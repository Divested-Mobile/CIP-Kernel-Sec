    This depends on fixes to FPU state management that have not been
    applied to 2.6.32.y.  In order to fix it, we would need to either
    pick only commit b3b0870ef3ff ("i387: do not preload FPU state at
    task switch time") which will hurt FP performance, or backport a
    large number of changes.  I did prepare a backport but don't feel
    confident enough to use it.
