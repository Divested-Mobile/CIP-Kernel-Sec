  debian/bwh: |-
    I can't see how this is a security issue.  There was an earlier issue
    that TPIDRURW leaked between tasks, but that was fixed by commit
    6a1c53124aa1 "ARM: 7403/1: tls: remove covert channel via TPIDRURW"
    in 3.4-rc1 and 3.2.17.  Possibly the security impact is specific to
    the way Qualcomm was (ab)using TPIDRURW?
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    unclear whether a4780adeefd042482f624f5e0d577bf9cdcbb760 or
      6a1c53124aa161eb624ce7b1e40ade728186d34c is sufficient to address the
      issue
