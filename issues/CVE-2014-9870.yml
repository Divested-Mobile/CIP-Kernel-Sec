  debian/bwh: |-
    I can't see how this is a security issue.  There was an earlier issue
    that TPIDRURW leaked between tasks, but that was fixed by commit
    6a1c53124aa1 "ARM: 7403/1: tls: remove covert channel via TPIDRURW"
    in 3.4-rc1 and 3.2.17.  Possibly the security impact is specific to
    the way Qualcomm was (ab)using TPIDRURW?
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: &id001 ['version:debian/3.11.5-1']
  debian/stretch-security: *id001
  mainline: [a4780adeefd042482f624f5e0d577bf9cdcbb760]
