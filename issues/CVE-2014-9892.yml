comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    This doesn't make sense - there should be no padding in a
    structure that has all 32-bit members, unless the natural
    alignment is explicitly overridden.  I consider this invalid.
    Additionally, snd_compr_tstamp and all the other sound
    compression related structures now have their alignment
    explicitly set to 4 to avoid compat issues on i386/amd64.
  debian/jmm: Fixed in Android 3.10 kernel, but unfixed in Linux mainline
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/tyhicks: Fix doesn't appear to have been sent upstream
