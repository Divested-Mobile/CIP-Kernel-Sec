  debian/bwh: |-
    This doesn't make sense - there should be no padding in a
    structure that has all 32-bit members, unless the natural
    alignment is explicitly overridden.  I consider this invalid.
    Additionally, snd_compr_tstamp and all the other sound
    compression related structures now have their alignment
    explicitly set to 4 to avoid compat issues on i386/amd64.
  debian/jmm: Fixed in Android 3.10 kernel, but unfixed in Linux mainline
