comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    This is compiler-dependent, and doesn't appear to have been demonstrated
    as an actual leak (yet).
  debian/jmm: Fixed in Android 3.10 kernel, but this is still unfixed in current mainline
ignore:
  mainline: minor and as-yet theoretical issue
  stable/4.9: upstream first
