comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    This is compiler-dependent, and doesn't appear to have been demonstrated
    as an actual leak (yet).
  debian/jmm: Fixed in Android 3.10 kernel, but this is still unfixed in current mainline
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/tyhicks: Fix doesn't appear to have been upstreamed
introduced-by:
  mainline: [1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2]
ignore:
  mainline: minor and as-yet theoretical issue
  stable/4.9: upstream first
