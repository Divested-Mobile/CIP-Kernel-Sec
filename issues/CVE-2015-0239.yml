    This revealed another earlier fix, commit 1a18a69b7623 ("KVM: x86
    emulator: reject SYSENTER in compatibility mode on AMD guests").
    It wasn't marked for stable but the bug might be exploitable by
    guest userland to crash the guest system.  I've queued it up for
    wheezy-security along with this.
