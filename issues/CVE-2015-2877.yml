description: '** DISPUTED ** Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) in the Linux kernel 2.6.32
  through 4.x does not prevent use of a write-timing side channel, which allows guest
  OS users to defeat the ASLR protection mechanism on other guest OS instances via
  a Cross-VM ASL INtrospection (CAIN) attack.  NOTE: the vendor states "Basically
  if you care about this attack vector, disable deduplication." Share-until-written
  approaches for memory conservation among mutually untrusting tenants are inherently
  detectable for information disclosure, and can be classified as potentially misunderstood
  behaviors rather than vulnerabilities.'

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    Depends on KSM, which needs to be explicitly enabled at run-time.
    It appears to be impractical to fix or mitigate this in KSM.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    The behavior represented by CVE-2015-2877 is inherent to Kernel
     Samepage Merging. To mitigate the issue, follow the steps above to disable
     KSM.
ignore:
  all: Intrinsic risk of KSM feature
