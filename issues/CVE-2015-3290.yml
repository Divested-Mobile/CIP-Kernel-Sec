    Seems to have been introduced by espfix64 in 3.16, but only in combination
    with commit 3f3c8b8c4b2a ("x86: Add workaround to NMI iret woes", 3.3)
    and commit e00b12e64be9 ("perf/x86: Further optimize copy_from_user_nmi()",
    3.13).  espfix64 was backported to 3.2 but the others weren't.
