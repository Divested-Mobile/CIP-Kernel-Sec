  debian/bwh: Both squeeze and wheezy have this issue.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Not sure if this was introduced with dbfcd91f06f0e2d5564b2fd184e9c2a43675f9ab ff.
    and thus wheezy not affected. Needs to be checked.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
