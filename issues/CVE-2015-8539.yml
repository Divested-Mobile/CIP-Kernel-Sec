  debian/carnil: |-
    possibly only ever affect 4.4 prereleases only, but needs double-
    check.
    Introduced by 146aa8b1453bd8f1ff2304ffb71b4ee0eb9acdcc (v4.4-rc1)?
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    verified this is an issue with precise's kernel, the second
     reproducer in the git commit results in a NULL pointer exception
  ubuntu/seth-arnold: |-
    Debian's triage suggested this was introduced by
     146aa8b1453bd8f1ff2304ffb71b4ee0eb9acdcc
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    As sbeattie mentioned above, this is present prior to 4.4.
     I'm setting the break commit to the start of git history which is
     after user keys were added
