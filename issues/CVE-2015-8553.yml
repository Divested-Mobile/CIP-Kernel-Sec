  debian/bwh: |-
    Upstream fix is not clearly correct; see discussions in the references.
    The kernel fix will be applied to 4.9, so we will need to add a
    Breaks against old qemu and revert the fix for the jessie backport.
  debian/carnil: |-
    qemu fix is in
    https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=2e87512eccf3c5e40f3142ff5a763f4f850839f4
    which is at least in qemu v2.5.0-rc0 onwards.
  debian/jmm: |-
    I've gotten in touch with the subsystems maintainers; the patch breaks
    qemu (as used by xen). While this was fixed upstream in qemu, the patch
    hasn't been merged yet since it would break with older versions of qemu
    I'm trying to find out which version is fine, so maybe we can carry that
    the xsa120-addendum.patch as a Debian-specific patch it's merged at some
    point
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/mdeslaur: see version 5 of XSA-120 advisory for updates patches
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    deferring as it introduced problems with some QEMU setups
    first fix is af6fc858a35b90e89ea7a7ee58e66628c55c776b; the
      regression fix doesn't seem to have made it upstream
    description is incorrect, the incomplete fix is to
      CVE-2015-2150
