  Debian-bwh: Upstream fix is not clearly correct; see discussions in the references.
  Debian-jmm: |-
    I've gotten in touch with the subsystems maintainers; the patch breaks
    qemu (as used by xen). While this was fixed upstream in qemu, the patch
    hasn't been merged yet since it would break with older versions of qemu
    I'm trying to find out which version is fine, so maybe we can carry that
    the xsa120-addendum.patch as a Debian-specific patch it's merged at some
    point
