  debian/bwh: |-
    I'm not sure exactly how far back this is needed as I can't see
    where the change of association is made.  But SCTP hasn't
    changed a whole lot since 2.6.32 and most other security fixes
    have been needed all the way back.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
