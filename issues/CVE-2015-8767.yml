description: SCTP denial of service during heartbeat timeout functions

    I'm not sure exactly how far back this is needed as I can't see
    where the change of association is made.  But SCTP hasn't
    changed a whole lot since 2.6.32 and most other security fixes
    have been needed all the way back.
