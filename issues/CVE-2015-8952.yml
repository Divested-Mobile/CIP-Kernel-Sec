  debian/bwh: |-
    The upstream fix (rewrite of mbcache) is too intrusive to backport.
    We will mitigate this with cond_resched() as suggested in comment 1
    on the bz.k.o bug report.  I didn't want to add the no_mbcache mount
    option as in comment 12 because it's a uAPI extension, but it has
    now been added upstream (commit cdb7ee4c6327) so I think it would be
    reasonable to add it to supported stable releases.
    The problem seems to have been introduced (or exacerbated) by commit
    1f3e55fe02d1 in 3.15, which added a retry loop in mb_cache_entry_alloc().
