    A known use-after-free bug in N_X25 has already been fixed
    (commit ee9159ddce14, no CVE assigned).  The Android security
    bulletin says this fixes an information leak, presumably because
    if receive_room is too large it will permit reading beyond a
    buffer.  We also need commit fd98e9419d8d ("isdn/gigaset: reset
    tty->receive_room when attaching ser_gigaset") to avoid a
    regression.

  debian/stretch-security: *id001
