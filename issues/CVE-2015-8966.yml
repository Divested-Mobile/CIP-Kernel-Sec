  debian/bwh: |-
    Introduced in 3.15 by commit 5d50ffd7c31d "locks: add new fcntl cmd
    values for handling file private locks".  No Debian kernel images
    were affected since we disabled OABI compatibility before this.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/ratliff: the fix commit is dated Dec. 2015
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    this was probably introduced with the Open File Descriptor
      Locks patches in the 3.15 kernel, likely 5d50ffd7.
