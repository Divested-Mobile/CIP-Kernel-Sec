comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    This is not a security flaw in itself, but a missing mitigation.
    Additionally, arm64 had no support for page protections in the
    kernel mapping before 4.0, so this is impractical to backport.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: &id001 ['version:debian/4.0.2-1']
  debian/stretch-security: *id001
  mainline: [c623b33b4e9599c6ac5076f7db7369eb9869aa04]
