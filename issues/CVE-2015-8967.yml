description: arm64 syscall table is not read-only

  debian/bwh: |-
    This is not a security flaw in itself, but a missing mitigation.
    Additionally, arm64 had no support for page protections in the
    kernel mapping before 4.0, so this is impractical to backport.
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: &id001 ['version:debian/4.0.2-1']
  debian/stretch-security: *id001
  mainline: [c623b33b4e9599c6ac5076f7db7369eb9869aa04]
