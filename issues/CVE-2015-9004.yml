  debian/canril: no release in 3.16-upstream-stable contained
  debian/carnil: |-
    According to upstream commit it should fix
    9fc81d87420d ("perf: Fix events installation
    during moving group"), which is in 3.19-rc1.
    so might actually be not affecting any other
    release, but needs check
    9fc81d87420d backported to 3.16.7-ckt4
    c3c87e770458 backported to 3.16.7-ckt6
    the fix for 3.16 is as well in 3.16.35 thus
    the vulnerability.
    So the issue was introduced and fixed in two
    different releases still while beeing maintained
    by the Ubuntu Kernel team and before "upstreamed"
    back.
  debian/nsl: "9fc81d87420d was backported to 3.16 in 3.16.35\nalong with the fix.\
    \ 3.16 was likely never \nvulnerable, but nonetheless has the fix."
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
