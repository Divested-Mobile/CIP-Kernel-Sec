description: The aio_mount function in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel does not properly
  restrict execute access, which makes it easier for local users to bypass intended
  SELinux W^X policy restrictions, and consequently gain privileges, via an io_setup
  system call.

    I think carnil pasted the wrong hash above.  Anyway, I wrote a test
    program and verified this does affect 3.2 and 3.16.
    Dependencies for 3.16:
    46b15caa7cb1 vfs, writeback: replace FS_CGROUP_WRITEBACK with SB_I_CGROUPWB
    90f8572b0f02 vfs: Commit to never having exectuables on proc and sysfs.
    Alternately we could assign a filesystem type flag instead of a superblock
    internal flag.  This is not practical to fix for 3.2, where aio does not
    have a filesystem.

    possibly introduced by bb646cdb12e75d82258c2f2e7746d5952d3e321a
    needs check.
