description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP
  Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6
  implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP
  fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An
  attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger
  the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which
  actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform
  any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do
  not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not
  actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be
  employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that
  already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of
  the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is
  communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping
  of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation)
  [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host
  A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B,
  reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of
  IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When
  Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received
  ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we
  previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being
  dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a
  DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are
  employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to
  drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned
  BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error
  messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session
  by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than
  1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned
  routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.
