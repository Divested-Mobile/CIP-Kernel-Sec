    On 3.16 the OOM killer usually kills the reproducer fairly quickly,
    but not always.  It still spams the kernel log and in some cases
    it seemed to cause a filesystem error causing / to go read-only.
    I assume 4.9 is also affected.

    Commit 9bfe5ded054b ("mm, oom: remove sleep from under oom_lock")
    is a mitigation for CVE-2016-10723.
