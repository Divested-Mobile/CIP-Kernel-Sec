    RH bugzilla lists the commit below and since they're deeply involved in KVM using
    that as the authoritative source
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    it sounds possibly like this might be a PowerKVM "rebrand"
     of CVE-2016-5412. One of the two commits to address that was
     93d17397e4e2182fdaad503e2f9da46202c0f1c3, which fixed a similar
     failure condition: a guest could trigger a host CPU to spin forever
     with interrupts disabled.  Furthermore, the IBM xforce vulnerability
     page notes that the issue was reported on July 22, 2016, which also
     happens to be the exact date of the aforementioned git commit.
    looks like this is actually
     ccec44563b18a0ce90e2d4f332784b3cb25c8e9c

    I haven't determined if this CVE is specific to IBM's
     PowerKVM Linux distribution or if this is an issue in the Linux
     kernel.
