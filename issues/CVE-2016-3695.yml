description: |-
  ACPI provides an error injection mechanism, EINJ, for debugging
  and testing the ACPI Platform Error Interface (APEI) and other RAS
  features. If supported by the firmware, ACPI specification 5.0 and
  later provide for a way to specify a physical memory address to which
  to inject the error.
  Injecting errors through EINJ can produce errors which to the
  platform are indistinguishable from real hardware errors. This can have
  undesirable side-effects, such as causing the platform to mark hardware
  as needing replacement.

  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    looks like it's finally getting traction upstream
    debian incorporated this patch in their secureboot kernel
    it's possible we will want/get CVEs for other issues
     addressed in the patch series containing this fix.
    still unfixed as of 2017-10-12
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    This CVE was assigned against an out-of-tree patch series.
     The Ubuntu kernel carries the patch series in Bionic and newer
     releases.
  bwh: |-
    This is a flaw in the secure modules/securelevel/lockdown patch sets.
    Mainline is not expected to prevent hardware access by privileged users.
