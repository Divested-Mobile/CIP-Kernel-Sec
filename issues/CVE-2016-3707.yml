comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    ... and when the feature is enabled by setting a sysctl.  So far
    as I can see, this is a debug feature that was not meant to be
    enabled on production systems.
  debian/carnil: |-
    This CVE is in effect only when the rt featureset
    is enabled, and the aptch features/all/rt/ping-sysrq.patch
    is active.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    only affects kernels with PREEMPT_RT applied and enabled,
      which is not the case in Ubuntu kernels.
