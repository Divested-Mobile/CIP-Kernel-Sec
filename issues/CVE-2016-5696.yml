  net/ipv4/tcp_input.c in the Linux kernel before 4.7 does not properly
  determine the rate of challenge ACK segments, which makes it easier for
  remote attackers to hijack TCP sessions via a blind in-window attack.

    MITIGATION: setting the net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit
      sysctl to some absurdly large number (as described in the lwn
      article referenced above)
    fix is going to land in Ubuntu kernels in this SRU cycle,
      with a likely release date of Aug 27. Earlier access to the kernels
      with the fix will be available from the -proposed pocket, though they
      come with the risk of being less tested.
