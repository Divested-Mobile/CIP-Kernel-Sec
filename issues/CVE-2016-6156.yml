  debian/bwh: It's fixed in 4.6.6 anyway, whether or not it matters to Debian
  debian/carnil: |-
    As far I can see the vulnerable code is present in 4.6.3
    but the CROS_EC_CHARDEV is not enabled in Debian builds.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
