  debian/bwh: It's fixed in 4.6.6 anyway, whether or not it matters to Debian
  debian/carnil: |-
    As far I can see the vulnerable code is present in 4.6.3
    but the CROS_EC_CHARDEV is not enabled in Debian builds.
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: &id001 ['version:debian/4.7.2-1']
  debian/stretch-security: *id001
  mainline: [096cdc6f52225835ff503f987a0d68ef770bb78e]
