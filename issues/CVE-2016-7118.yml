description: |-
  fs/fcntl.c in the "aufs 3.2.x+setfl-debian" patch in the linux-image
  package 3.2.0-4 (kernel 3.2.81-1) in Debian wheezy mishandles F_SETFL fcntl
  calls on directories, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
  (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via standard filesystem
  operations, as demonstrated by scp from an AUFS filesystem.

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    Debian-specific bug, introduced while making the check for the new
    setfl operation ABI-backward-compatible.  Affects 3.2.81-1
    (wheezy-security) and 3.16.36-1 (jessie-proposed-updates) only.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/sbeattie: likely debian only, no F_SETFL in our aufs code
introduced-by:
  mainline: never
