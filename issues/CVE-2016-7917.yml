description: |-
  The nfnetlink_rcv_batch function in net/netfilter/nfnetlink.c in the Linux
  kernel before 4.5 does not check whether a batch message's length field is
  large enough, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
  kernel memory or cause a denial of service (infinite loop or out-of-bounds
  read) by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
