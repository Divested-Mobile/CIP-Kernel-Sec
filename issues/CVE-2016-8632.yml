description: |-
  The tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel through
  4.8.11 does not validate the relationship between the minimum fragment
  length and the maximum packet size, which allows local users to gain
  privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) by
  leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
