description: |-
  Integer overflow in the mem_check_range function in
  drivers/infiniband/sw/rxe/rxe_mr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.10 allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption), obtain
  sensitive information from kernel memory, or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a write or read request involving the "RDMA protocol over
  infiniband" (aka Soft RoCE) technology.
