  drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 allows local
  users to bypass integer overflow checks, and cause a denial of service
  (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact, by leveraging access
  to a vfio PCI device file for a VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl call, aka a
  "state machine confusion bug."
