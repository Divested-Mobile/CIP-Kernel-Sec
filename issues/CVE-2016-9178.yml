description: |-
  The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux
  kernel before 4.7.5 does not initialize a certain integer variable, which
  allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
  by triggering failure of a get_user_ex call.

    If this issue is fixed, then one needs to assure
    to not introduce the privilege escalation issue
    as present in 4.4.22 through 4.4.28 (cf.
    CVE-2016-9644) due to a wrong backport/missing
    backport of 548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840
    as well. See notes in CVE-2016-9644
  Debian-jmm: 'Linus prepared a backport for 4.4.31: dc1555e670c373bfa4ca2e1e2f839d5fe2b4501a'

    the fix for this introduces CVE-2016-9644. NOTE: This
      is only an issue if 1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af
      (added in 4.8) is backported without also backporting
      548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 (added
      in 4.6). However, the first attempt at backporting
      548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 was pulled shortly
      thereafter.
    The git commit for xenial is
