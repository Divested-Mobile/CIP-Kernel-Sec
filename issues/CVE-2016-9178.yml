description: |-
  The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux
  kernel before 4.7.5 does not initialize a certain integer variable, which
  allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
  by triggering failure of a get_user_ex call.

    the fix for this introduces CVE-2016-9644. NOTE: This
      is only an issue if 1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af
      (added in 4.8) is backported without also backporting
      548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 (added
      in 4.6). However, the first attempt at backporting
      548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 was pulled shortly
      thereafter.
    The git commit for xenial is
      1f4da631f0159d77908edb10f15e84642980cf16.
