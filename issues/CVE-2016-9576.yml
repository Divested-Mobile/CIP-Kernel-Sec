description: |-
  The blk_rq_map_user_iov function in block/blk-map.c in the Linux kernel
  before 4.8.14 does not properly restrict the type of iterator, which allows
  local users to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause
  a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging access to a /dev/sg
  device.

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    This CVE is for the vulnerability fixed by commit a0ac402cfcdc
    "Don't feed anything but regular iovec's to blk_rq_map_user_iov",
    but that only addresses half the problem.  The remaining issue is
    covered by CVE-2016-10088, and commit 128394eff343 "sg_write()/
    bsg_write() is not fit to be called under KERNEL_DS" is a
    complete fix for both CVEs.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    requires access to /dev/sg*, which unprivileged users
      normally do not have access to.
