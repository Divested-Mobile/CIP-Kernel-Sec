description: |-
  The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux
  kernel 4.4.22 through 4.4.28 contains extended asm statements that are
  incompatible with the exception table, which allows local users to obtain
  root access on non-SMEP platforms via a crafted application.  NOTE: this
  vulnerability exists because of incorrect backporting of the CVE-2016-9178
  patch to older kernels.

    This is only an issue if 1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af
    (added in 4.8) is backported without also backporting
    548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 (added in 4.6), as such
    the stock upstream kernel, unstable, 3.16.x and 3.2.x were never
    affected

    1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af
      was applied to the 4.4 stable series (in xenial
      as 1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af) to fix
      CVE-2016-9178, and then got reverted from stable in 4.4.30
      (in xenial as 2da13e7f631bb13658e00e61fdea050da25e69e7).
      548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 was
      also very briefly applied to stable in 4.4.29, but
      reverted at the same time due to problems (in xenial as
      102d19689b2dd4f639a14dfd3f52ce19b5d7bb17). For xenial/4.4
      derived kernels, this CVE is fixed with the reversion in
      2da13e7f631bb13658e00e61fdea050da25e69e7. However, this leaves
      CVE-2016-9178 unfixed.
