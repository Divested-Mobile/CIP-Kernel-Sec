    Commit 362bca57f5d7 "ALSA: pcm: prevent UAF in snd_pcm_info" claims to
    fix this, but the UAF was already removed in 4.13 by commit e11f0f90a626
    "ALSA: pcm: remove SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL1_INFO internal command".  Based on
    the latter commit message it appears that the UAF is totally harmless
    in practice.

    There's currently not much info available on this but the CVE
     description makes it sound like it affects the upstream kernel.
