  Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with
  https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86
  (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April
  2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to
  Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat.
  With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down
  address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE
  binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base.
  Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to
  allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the
  first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD
  segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is
  supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    fixed upstream in 4.1, so xenial and newer had it
    went through stable, trusty had it in 3.13.0-56.93,
      precise in 3.2.0-91.129, vivid in 3.19.0-19.19
