  debian/bwh: |-
    It's unclear to me whether this deserves a specific fix, separate
    from that for CVE-2017-1000364.
  debian/carnil: |-
    It's unclear wich of the stack-clash patchset patches fixes the
    issue in specific.
  debian/jmm: |-
    Red Hat, Ubuntu and SuSE all closed this bug with a reference that it's
    fixed along with the other fixes, shall we just do the same?
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    it's unclear which of the stack clash patches addressed this
      issue, but it does seem to have been addressed in that patch set.
