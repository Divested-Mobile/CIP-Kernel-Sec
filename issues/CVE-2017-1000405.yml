description: |-
  The Linux Kernel versions 2.6.38 through 4.14 have a problematic use of
  pmd_mkdirty() in the touch_pmd() function inside the THP implementation.
  touch_pmd() can be reached by get_user_pages(). In such case, the pmd will
  become dirty. This scenario breaks the new can_follow_write_pmd()'s logic -
  pmd can become dirty without going through a COW cycle. This bug is not as
  severe as the original "Dirty cow" because an ext4 file (or any other
  regular file) cannot be mapped using THP. Nevertheless, it does allow us to
  overwrite read-only huge pages. For example, the zero huge page and sealed
  shmem files can be overwritten (since their mapping can be populated using
  THP). Note that after the first write page-fault to the zero page, it will
  be replaced with a new fresh (and zeroed) thp.

    But in 3.2 dirty bits didn't work on s390, so the backported version of
    can_follow_write_pmd() doesn't use them.
  debian/carnil: |-
    The upstream commit 8310d48b125d19fcd9521d83b8293e63eb1646aa
    allows the race condition, and was backported to 3.2.87,
    3.16.42 and 4.9.7.
  ubuntu/smb: |-
    Added introducing commit as suggested by RH. We backported that into
    Trusty and later but not into Precise.
