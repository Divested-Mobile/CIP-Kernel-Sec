description: |-
  The acpi_ns_terminate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nsutils.c in the
  Linux kernel before 4.12 does not flush the operand cache and causes a
  kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
  from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel
  through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.

  Debian-bwh: |-
    This is not a valid issue as ACPI tables are trusted.  The issue of
    kASLR being broken through stack traces is mitigated by commit
    bb5e5ce545f2 "x86/dumpstack: Remove kernel text addresses from stack
    dump".) and by the dmesg_restrict feature.
