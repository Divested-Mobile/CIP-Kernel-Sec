comments:
  Debian-bwh: |-
    This has presumably been present for ever, i.e. since commit
    f0706e828e96 "[MAC80211]: Add mac80211 wireless stack." in 2.6.22
  Debian-carnil: |-
    "KRACK" also affects the management parts in the kernel,
    mac80211 part.
    Needs follow-up fixes 2bdd713b92a9cade239d3c7d15205a09f556624d
