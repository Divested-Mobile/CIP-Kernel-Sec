description: |-
  The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in
  the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes
  a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
  information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism
  (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.

  debian/bwh: |-
    This is not a security issue, since ACPI tables must already be
    trusted.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    As of 17.04, KASLR is not yet enabled by default in Ubuntu
    See the patchwork.k.o reference for a possible fix. As of 2018-10-01,
     it has not yet been merged upstream.
