description: |-
  The acpi_ps_complete_final_op() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/psobject.c
  in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the node and node_ext
  caches and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain
  sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection
  mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.

    This is not a security issue, since ACPI tables must already be
    trusted.

    As of 17.04, KASLR is not yet enabled by default in Ubuntu
    See the patchwork.k.o reference for a possible fix. As of 2017-08-25,
     it has not yet been merged upstream.
