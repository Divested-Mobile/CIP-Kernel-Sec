description: |-
  The acpi_ns_evaluate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nseval.c in the
  Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a
  kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information
  from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel
  through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.

comments:
  Debian-bwh: |-
    This is not a security issue, since ACPI tables must already be
    trusted.
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    As of 17.04, KASLR is not yet enabled by default in Ubuntu
    See the patchwork.k.o reference for a possible fix. As of 2017-08-25,
     it has not yet been merged upstream.
