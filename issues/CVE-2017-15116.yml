    Clearly we can't apply the upstream fix for this, but need to guard
    against the null pointer somehow.  I can't work out which pointer
    can be null though.
    I've now looked at the RHEL 7 update, and the comment indicates
    that the vulnerable code is in crypto/drbg.c.  I verified that
    it does have a weird special case for slen == 0 && seed != NULL
    which no other RNG does.  This was added in mainline in 3.17 and
    then backported to RHEL's 3.10 branch.

    looks like it's a series of commits to stop using the old
      interface. Conversion begins with acec27ff35af9caf34d76d16ee17ff3b292e7d83
