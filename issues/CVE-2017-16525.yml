  Debian-bwh: |-
    There are two parts, introduced in 2.6.18 by commit 73e487fdb75f
    "[PATCH] USB console: fix disconnection issues" and in 4.11 by
    commit 0e517c93dc02 "USB: serial: console: clean up sanity checks".
    The older part seems unlikely to be exploitable, but should be fixed
    anyway.
