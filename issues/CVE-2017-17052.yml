description: |-
  The mm_init function in kernel/fork.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12.10
  does not clear the ->exe_file member of a new process's mm_struct, allowing
  a local attacker to achieve a use-after-free or possibly have unspecified
  other impact by running a specially crafted program.
