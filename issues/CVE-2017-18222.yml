    Introduced in 4.4 when the driver was added.  There was an
    attempted fix for this in 4.12 (commit 412b65d15a7f "net: hns: fix
    ethtool_get_strings overflow ...") but it is far from complete.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Later on d61d263c8d82db7c4404a29ebc29674b1c0c05c9 (4.16-rc7)
    is applied, reverting partially 412b65d15a7f and returning EOPNOTSUPP
    for not implemented ethtool flags.
