description: |-
  The arch_timer_reg_read_stable macro in arch/arm64/include/asm/arch_timer.h
  in the Linux kernel before 4.13 allows local users to cause a denial of
  service (infinite recursion) by writing to a file under /sys/kernel/debug
  in certain circumstances, as demonstrated by a scenario involving debugfs,
  ftrace, PREEMPT_TRACER, and FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER.

    I'm not convinced this is really a security issue.  Anyway, the
    vulnerable code path was introduced in 4.12 by commit 6acc71ccac71
    "arm64: arch_timer: Allows a CPU-specific erratum to only affect a
    subset of CPUs".

  mainline: [6acc71ccac7187fc0ef85f10bd09c2058f21fab5]
