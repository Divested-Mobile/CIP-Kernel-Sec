  Debian-bwh: |-
    The off-by-one error was introduced in Linux 2.6.12 (just before
    the switch to git), as a (very minor) information leak.  The above
    commit increased the security impact - writing exactly "\n" can
    result in a buffer under-read and oops, which is what this CVE
    describes.  Later, commit bb646cdb12e7 "proc_pid_attr_write():
    switch to memdup_user()" reduced the buffer size so there is also
    a buffer over-read.  However, I think that has no additional impact
    since even SLOB pads heap allocations to at least 2 bytes.
  Debian-carnil: Possibly introduced in 3.5-rc1 with d6ea83ec6864e9297fa8b00ec3dae183413a90e3
  Ubuntu-PHLin: this code is sick from 1da177e4, commit bb646cdb mentioned in the
    fix is where this flaw can cause problem.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
