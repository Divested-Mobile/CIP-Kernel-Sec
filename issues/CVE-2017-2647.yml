  Debian-bwh: |-
    The function that dereferences the null pointer depends on kernel
    version.  keyring_search_aux() was refactored after 3.2 so that
    part of it its logic is in keyring_search_iterator(), and that's
    where the null dereference is done.  But the issue is
    fundamentally the same.

    Same fix as for CVE-2017-6951. But CVE-2017-6951 is for a NULL
    pointer dereference in th keyring_search_aux when type is "dead".
    CVE-2017-2647 is for a null pointer dereference in
    keyring_search_iterator
