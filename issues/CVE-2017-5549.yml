description: |-
  The klsi_105_get_line_state function in drivers/usb/serial/kl5kusb105.c in
  the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 places uninitialized heap-memory contents
  into a log entry upon a failure to read the line status, which allows local
  users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log.
