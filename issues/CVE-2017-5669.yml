description: |-
  The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does
  not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which
  allows local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection
  mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget
  and shmat system calls in a privileged context.
