  Debian-carnil: |-
    partial mitigations via 0cb5b30698fdc8f6b4646012e3acb4ddce430788
    "kvm: vmx: Scrub hardware GPRs at VM-exit" in 4.15-rc7
    Initial support for mitigation work for Spectre variant 2
    (indirect branch speculation) vulnerability included in
    4.15-rc8, 4.14.14-rc1, 4.9.77-rc1.
    Mark the entries which included initial retpoline support
    to mitigate Spectre v2 as the 'fixed' ones. Still work on
    microcode and/or gcc is needed to be effective.
    Unclear if we should as well mark it as pending for the
    Debian branches, so not yet added a marking for the sid
    branch accordingly.
    4.14.17-1 upload enforces a dependency on the used compiler
    with retpoline support.
  Ubuntu-mdeslaur: intel-microcode updates were reverted in usn-3531-2
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: Variant 2, aka "Spectre"
