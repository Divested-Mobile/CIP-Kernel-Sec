description: The time subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.9.9, when CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
  is enabled, allows local users to discover real PID values (as distinguished from
  PID values inside a PID namespace) by reading the /proc/timer_list file, related
  to the print_timer function in kernel/time/timer_list.c and the __timer_stats_timer_set_start_info
  function in kernel/time/timer.c.

comments:
  Debian-bwh: |-
    The upstream "fix" for this is to remove the feature, as it is
    redundant with tracing.  I don't think that change is
    acceptable for stable branches, other than possibly 4.9.  We
    could instead prevent processes outside the initial pid
    namespace from opening the file.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
