description: The time subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.9.9, when CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
  is enabled, allows local users to discover real PID values (as distinguished from
  PID values inside a PID namespace) by reading the /proc/timer_list file, related
  to the print_timer function in kernel/time/timer_list.c and the __timer_stats_timer_set_start_info
  function in kernel/time/timer.c.

comments:
  Debian-bwh: |-
    The upstream "fix" for this is to remove the feature, as it is
    redundant with tracing.  I don't think that change is
    acceptable for stable branches, other than possibly 4.9.  We
    could instead prevent processes outside the initial pid
    namespace from opening the file.
    Although MITRE's description only refers to /proc/timer_list,
    /proc/timer_stats also exposes pids if CONFIG_TIMER_STATS is
    enabled.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  bwh: |-
    An alternate fix would be commit 8e7df2b5b7f2 "timer/debug: Change
    /proc/timer_list from 0444 to 0400".
