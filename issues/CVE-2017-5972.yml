description: |-
  The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN
  cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
  consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack
  against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7.

  Debian-bwh: |-
    This is described as a defect in SYN cookies, but it's really a
    scaling limitation that was never intended to be addressed by
    cookies.  The listening socket's lock is held while processing
    SYN packets, so an attacker only needs to keep 1 CPU busy to
    achieve DoS.  While the upstream fix looks simple, I think it
    depends on a number of earlier commits.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    probably addressed by Eric Dumazet's "lockless listener" series
      (final git commit in series listed in references)
