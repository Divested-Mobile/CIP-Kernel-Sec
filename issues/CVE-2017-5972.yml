description: |-
  The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN
  cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
  consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack
  against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7.
