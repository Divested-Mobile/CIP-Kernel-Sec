description: |-
  The LLC subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.9.13 does not ensure that a
  certain destructor exists in required circumstances, which allows local
  users to cause a denial of service (BUG_ON) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via crafted system calls.

    The upstream commit refers to an added assertion in 3.12, but the
    purpose of that assertion was to catch potential UAF cases so I
    assume this bug could result in a UAF in 3.2.  Note that this bug
    is in the obscure llc2 module, not the basic llc support used by
    some other protocols.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
