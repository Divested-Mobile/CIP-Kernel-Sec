description: |-
  The ip_cmsg_recv_checksum function in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux
  kernel before 4.10.1 has incorrect expectations about skb data layout,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or
  possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, as
  demonstrated by use of the MSG_MORE flag in conjunction with loopback UDP
  transmission.
