description: |-
  The hashbin_delete function in net/irda/irqueue.c in the Linux kernel
  before 4.9.13 improperly manages lock dropping, which allows local users to
  cause a denial of service (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA
  devices.

    This actually changes locking, not just lockdep annotations.
    So I think it fixes a potential deadlock.
