description: |-
  net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.1 does not properly
  restrict association peel-off operations during certain wait states, which
  allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid unlock and double
  free) via a multithreaded application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
  because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5986.
