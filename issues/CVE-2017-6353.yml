description: |-
  net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.1 does not properly
  restrict association peel-off operations during certain wait states, which
  allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid unlock and double
  free) via a multithreaded application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
  because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5986.

  debian/bwh: Introduced by attempted fix for CVE-2017-5986
  debian/carnil: |-
    "technically" 3.2-wheezy-security and 3.16-jessie-security are not
    affected since we did not apply 2dcab598484185dea7ec22219c76dcdd59e3cb90
    but maybe we want to make an exception here and threat this CVE never-
    theless as affected for all branches.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    both CVE-2017-5986 and CVE-2017-6353 will be addressed at the
     same time.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    See marc.info link for a fix that is in the process of landing in
     Linus' tree.
