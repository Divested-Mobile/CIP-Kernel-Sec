description: |-
  Race condition in kernel/ucount.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.2 allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls that
  leverage certain decrement behavior that causes incorrect interaction
  between put_ucounts and get_ucounts.
