    Problem is said to not affect newer kernel, but
    the fixing commit needs to be found still which
    resolves the issue.
    There is c1644fe041ebaf6519f6809146a77c3ead9193af which changes
    name of the dead type to ".dead" to prevent user access.
fixed-by:
  linux-3.16.y: [c53ee259ad3da891e191dee7af119af340f9c01b]
