description: |-
  The sg_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in the Linux kernel through
  4.10.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer
  overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large command
  size in an SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN ioctl call, leading to out-of-bounds write
  access in the sg_write function.
