    This issue seems to include only read/write, as mmap is not
    covered by the commit referenced.  So I can't see a security
    benefit in fixing just this, although there is a *stability*
    benefit for newer versions with CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
