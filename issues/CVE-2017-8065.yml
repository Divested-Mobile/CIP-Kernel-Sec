description: |-
  crypto/ccm.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x through 4.10.12 interacts
  incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to
  cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual
  page for a DMA scatterlist.
