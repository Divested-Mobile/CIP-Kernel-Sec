    Probably fixed by commit 6fb05e0dd32e "[media] saa7164: fix double fetch
    PCIe access condition" in linux-next.
  Ubuntu-jdstrand: |-
    android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are
     not supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels
    linux-lts-saucy no longer receives official support
    linux-lts-quantal no longer receives official support
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    Marking this issue as low since it requires relatively uncommon
     hardware
