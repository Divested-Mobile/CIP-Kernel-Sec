comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    Malicious ISA cards aren't worth worrying about, unlike USB devices.
    Also, Debian doesn't build the OSS drivers and they have been removed
    upstream.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    unfixed as of 2017-08-24
    OSS msnd pinnacle driver, Ubuntu kernels have OSS drivers disabled.
