    This is fixed for bnx2x specifically by commits 2b16f048729b
    "net: create skb_gso_validate_mac_len()" and 8914a595110a
    "bnx2x: disable GSO where gso_size is too big for hardware".
    But this is really a core networking bug and must be fixed
    there, because other drivers and hardware are almost
    certainly affected.
    The fix depends on the ndo_features_check operation (or its
    predecessor ndo_gso_check), which doesn't exist in 3.16.

    apparently the CVE is specifically associated only with
    2b16f048729b and 8914a595110a, so consider it released
    with those two commits. The two commited are as well to
    be included in 4.14.102 and 4.9.159.
    Do we maybe need a separate CVE for the generic issue?
