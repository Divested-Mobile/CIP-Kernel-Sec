  debian/bwh: |-
    POWER9 support was added around Linux 4.6, so this doesn't affect
    older branches.
fixed-by:
  debian/buster-security: ['version:debian/4.13.10-1']
  debian/stretch-security: ['version:debian/4.9.65-1']
  mainline: [c1fa0768a8713b135848f78fd43ffc208d8ded70]
  stable/4.9: [f89f25b531471a6ba43f0b5658f9359fcf33a285]
