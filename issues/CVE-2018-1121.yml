  Debian-carnil: |-
    The issue will likely not be addressed, given the
    issue is faily minor and every possible solution
    comes with either a performance cost or still racy
    situation.
  Ubuntu-mdeslaur: this may need to be fixed in the kernel, not in procps
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: As of 2018-10-01, no upstream fix is available.
ignore:
  all: |-
    This is a relatively minor issue and seems unlikely to be practical
    to fix.
  linux-3.16.y: Fix is likely not be possible without major side effects
  linux-3.2.y: EOL
