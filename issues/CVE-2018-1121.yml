    The issue will likely not be addressed, given the
    issue is faily minor and every possible solution
    comes with either a performance cost or still racy
    situation.
  ubuntu/mdeslaur: this may need to be fixed in the kernel, not in procps
  ubuntu/tyhicks: As of 2018-10-01, no upstream fix is available.

    This is a relatively minor issue and seems unlikely to be practical
    to fix.
  stable/3.16: Fix is likely not be possible without major side effects
  stable/3.2: EOL
