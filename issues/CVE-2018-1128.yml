    If I understand this rightly, this is a vulnerability in the Ceph
    server, not the in-kernel client.  But the fix is an incompatible
    protocol change, and that's why the client needs to be updated too.
    I don't think this is practical for 3.16 as the protocol change
    seems to depend on message signatures which were added in 3.19.
fixed-by:
