description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2.
  vbg_misc_device_ioctl() in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads
  the same user data twice with copy_from_user. The header part of the user
  data is double-fetched, and a malicious user thread can tamper with the
  critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out) in the header between the
  two fetches because of a race condition, leading to severe kernel errors,
  such as buffer over-accesses. This bug can cause a local denial of service
  and information leakage.
