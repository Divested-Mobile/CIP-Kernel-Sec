  debian/bwh: |-
    I'm very hesistant to remove support for filesystems
    without a FUSE-based alternative (like we have for ntfs).  I do
    support restricting the set tried by "mount -t auto" and any
    other tools that do similar probing.
  debian/jmm: Matthew Wilcox recommends disabling it, might be worth considering for
    buster
