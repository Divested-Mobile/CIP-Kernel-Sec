    I don't think this is a real issue.  The multiplicands are a
    constant 4 of type size_t and a variable of type int which was
    already range-checked to be no <= INT_MAX/2.  The latter
    will be promoted to size_t (i.e. unsigned int or unsigned long)
    and the result will be <= 2*INT_MAX which is representable by
    either of those types.
