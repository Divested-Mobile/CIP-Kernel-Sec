    fa0f527358bd (4.19-rc1) is the introducing commit
    beeing part of the (upstream) fixes for CVE-2018-5391.
    There is no stable release which backported this
    (without) 5d407b071dc3. In fact not yet either in
    a 4.18.x or 4.9.x.
    When upstream fixes for CVE-2018-5391 land in Debian
    branch or are in a stable version, then 5d407b071dc3
    needs to be added to not make the CVE-2018-14641
    open.
    For experimental suite technically it was affected
    and fixed though with 4.19~rc4-1~exp1 upload.
fixed-by:
  mainline: [5d407b071dc369c26a38398326ee2be53651cfe4]
