    fa0f527358bd (4.19-rc1) is the introducing commit
    beeing part of the (upstream) fixes for CVE-2018-5391.
    There is no stable release which backported this
    (without) 5d407b071dc3. In fact not yet either in
    a 4.18.x or 4.9.x.
    When upstream fixes for CVE-2018-5391 land in Debian
    branch or are in a stable version, then 5d407b071dc3
    needs to be added to not make the CVE-2018-14641
    open.
    For experimental suite technically it was affected
    and fixed though with 4.19~rc4-1~exp1 upload.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    this vulnerability is a result of the fix for
      CVE-2018-5391/FragmentSmack; however, an alternative fix for
      CVE-2018-5391 was to revert c2a936600f78aea00d3312ea4b66a79a4619f9b4,
      which is what the Ubuntu kernels used.
