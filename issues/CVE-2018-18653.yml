description: |-
  The Linux kernel, as used in Ubuntu 18.10 and when booted with UEFI Secure
  Boot enabled, allows privileged local users to bypass intended Secure Boot
  restrictions and execute untrusted code by loading arbitrary kernel
  modules. This occurs because a modified kernel/module.c, in conjunction
  with certain configuration options, leads to mishandling of the result of
  signature verification.

  bwh: Ubuntu-specific issue
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    from the commit addressing the issue:
      Recent versions of the "secure boot lockdown" patches introduced
      support for using IMA signatures for module signing instead of
      the standard mechanism. This was causing issues and was removed,
      but the code was missed which actually defers the verification to
      IMA when IMA enforcement is enabled. With our config this means
      that by default module signatures are not being enforced under
      kernel lockdown.
