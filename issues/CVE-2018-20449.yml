    I consider hashing pointers to be a complete fix.  Additionally
    debugfs is only accessible to root by default.

    Issue mitigated with commit
    ad67b74d2469d9b82aaa572d76474c95bc484d57 ("printk: hash
    addresses printed with %p").

    Not very convinced about the report as it only was throwed in
    earlier this year on the debian security-tracker mailinglist.
    Was it reported upstream? hidma_dbg.c introduced with
    570d0176296f0d17c4b5ab206ad4a4bc027b863b in 4.7-rc1.

    Two mitigating factors for this issue are that debugfs files are
     restricted to root and KASLR is only used in 18.04 and newer
