  debian/bwh: |-
    This is a kernel pointer leak through debugfs, so not a
    significant security issue.  I will fix it along with other
    pointer leaks.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    debugfs is only accessible by the root user in Ubuntu
    The patch that is listed as the fix for this issue quietly fixes the
     info leak while being focused on improving locking. Only the info leak is
     referenced by this CVE.
