    I think this is not a real vulnerability, as explained in
    https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/07/1
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    while this specific ioctl may or may not be vulnerable, the
     fix is generic aenough to possibly block other vulnerabilities.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    Only the i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl() changes are technically needed
     for this CVE. It would be ideal to audit the callers of the other changed
     functions in the fix commit.
    This CVE is being disputed. See the oss-security emails on
     2019-02-07 for details.
