    The above merge only addresses only SSB (CVE-2018-3639).
    This issue (CVE-2018-3693) is closely related to Spectre v1
    (CVE-2017-5753) and is being mitigated in a similar way, using
    array_index_nospec().  The same as with Spectre v1, this will
    be an ongoing process.

    3b78ce4a34b761c7fe13520de822984019ff1a8f (4.17-rc7) merges
    the speculative store buffer bypass fixes (for x86 side).
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    Also known as "Bounds Check Bypass Store"
    This issue is mitigated using the same techniques as CVE-2017-5753.
     Ubuntu and the rest of the Linux kernel community will continue to monitor
     for vulnerable instances in the kernel and insert speculation barriers, as
     needed.
