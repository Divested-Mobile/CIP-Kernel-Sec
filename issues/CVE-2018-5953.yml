  Debian-bwh: |-
    The upstream fix was to obscure formatted pointer values by
    default.  This carries a high risk of regression so I don't
    think it should be backported.  A more targetted fix should
    be possible.
  bwh: |-
    There has also been a specific change to remove printing of
    virtual addresses from swiotlb entirely.
