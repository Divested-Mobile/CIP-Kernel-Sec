    The upstream fix was to obscure formatted pointer values by
    default.  This carries a high risk of regression so I don't
    think it should be backported.  A more targetted fix should
    be possible.

    This is an information leak that requires access to the system
    log. It can therefore be mitigated with
    CONFIG_SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT or sysctl kernel.dmesg_restrict.
