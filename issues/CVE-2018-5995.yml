  debian/bwh: |-
    The upstream fix was to obscure formatted pointer values by
    default.  This carries a high risk of regression so I don't
    think it should be backported.  A more targetted fix should
    be possible.
  debian/carnil: |-
    4.9 stretch-security marked as ignored for tracking given the
    kernel log is restricted to root by default. But as 4.9.171
    includes the fix the fix will land in a stretch point release
    as well. So not retiring it yet to mark the fixed version
    later on.

    This is an information leak that requires access to the system
    log. It can therefore be mitigated with
    CONFIG_SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT or sysctl kernel.dmesg_restrict.
