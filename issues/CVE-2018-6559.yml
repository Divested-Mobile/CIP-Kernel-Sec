    This CVE is specific to Ubuntu since Ubuntu allows overlayfs mounts
     inside of user namespaces
    This flaw was previously discovered and fixed as part of
     CVE-2015-1328. The fix for CVE-2015-1328 was incorrectly dropped from the
     Ubuntu kernel during a merge with related changes in the upstream Linux
     kernel. CVE-2018-6559 represents the portion of CVE-2015-1328 that was
     incorrectly reintroduced into the Ubuntu kernel.
