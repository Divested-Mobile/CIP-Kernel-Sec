  The Linux kernel, as used in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10, allows
  local users to obtain names of files in which they would not normally be
  able to access via an overlayfs mount inside of a user namespace.

    This CVE is specific to Ubuntu since Ubuntu allows overlayfs mounts
     inside of user namespaces
    This flaw was previously discovered and fixed as part of
     CVE-2015-1328. The fix for CVE-2015-1328 was incorrectly dropped from the
     Ubuntu kernel during a merge with related changes in the upstream Linux
     kernel. CVE-2018-6559 represents the portion of CVE-2015-1328 that was
     incorrectly reintroduced into the Ubuntu kernel.
