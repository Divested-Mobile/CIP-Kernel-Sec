    All addresses formatted with %p are now hashed, so I don't think
    this needs to be specifically addressed upstream.

    This is an information leak that requires access to the system
    log. It can therefore be mitigated with
    CONFIG_SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT or sysctl kernel.dmesg_restrict.
