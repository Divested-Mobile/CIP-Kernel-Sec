  The aoedisk_debugfs_show function in drivers/block/aoe/aoeblk.c in the
  Linux kernel through 4.16.4rc4 allows local users to obtain sensitive
  address information by reading "ffree: " lines in a debugfs file.

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    The upstream fix was to obscure logged pointer values by
    default.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Likely as other reports from "ADLab of VenusTech" not reported to
    upstream?
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    Two mitigating factors for this issue are that debugfs files are
     restricted to root and KASLR is only used in 18.04 and newer
