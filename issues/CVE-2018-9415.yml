  debian/bwh: |-
    The Android bulletin links to a patch for PCI that *wasn't*
    applied upstream (and isn't needed), but based on the
    description as "AMBA driver" I found what I think is the actual
    upstream fix.
    Introduced in Linux 4.0 by commit 3cf385713460 "ARM: 8256/1:
    driver coamba: add device binding path 'driver_override'".
  debian/carnil: |-
    There was possibly intiial confusion re CVE-2018-9415 and
    the second assigned CVE-2018-9385 which are related.
  debian/jmm: Unclear, might affect drivers/amba in some way?
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    the fix to drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c in the first patchwork
      link may be needed, too.
