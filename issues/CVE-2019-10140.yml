description: |-
  A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel's, versions up to 3.10,
  implementation of overlayfs. An attacker with local access can create a
  denial of service situation via NULL pointer dereference in
  ovl_posix_acl_create function in fs/overlayfs/dir.c. This can allow
  attackers with ability to create directories on overlayfs to crash the
  kernel creating a denial of service (DOS).
