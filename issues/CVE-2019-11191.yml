description: |-
  The Linux kernel through 5.0.7, when CONFIG_IA32_AOUT is enabled and
  ia32_aout is loaded, allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid a.out
  programs (if any exist) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in
  load_aout_binary() in fs/binfmt_aout.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access()
  check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat.

  Debian-bwh: Only ELF supports ASLR.
  Debian-carnil: |-
    CVE is for the issue in binfmt_aout.c specifically.
    Upstream plans to deprecate a.out format.
  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    configuration changes to disable i386 a.out support are in
     progress.
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    This only affects i386 Ubuntu kernels. Additionally, it is very
     unlikely that systems will have a setuid a.out program installed.
  bwh: Only ELF supports ASLR.
