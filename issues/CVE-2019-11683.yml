  udp_gro_receive_segment in net/ipv4/udp_offload.c in the Linux kernel 5.x
  before 5.0.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (slab-out-of-bounds memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via UDP packets with a 0 payload, because of mishandling of padded
  packets, aka the "GRO packet of death" issue.

  Debian-carnil: |-
    Fixes: e20cf8d3f1f7 ("udp: implement GRO for plain UDP
    sockets.") which is introduced in 5.0-rc1
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    The receiving socket has to have the UDP_GRO socket option explicitly
     enabled with a call to setsockopt(2). UDP sockets are not vulnerable to this
     attack by default.
