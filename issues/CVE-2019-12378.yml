description: |-
  An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in
  the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra,
  which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
  dereference and system crash).

  debian/bwh: |-
    There was already a null check before dereferencing the pointer.
    No security impact.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    I've reviewed all of our kernels. There's no security impact here so
     we'll ignore this disputed CVE.
fixed-by:
  mainline: never

  all: Invalid
