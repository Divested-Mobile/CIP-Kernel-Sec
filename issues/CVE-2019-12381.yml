description: |-
  An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the
  Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which
  might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
  dereference and system crash).

    There was already a null check before dereferencing the pointer.
    No security impact.
