description: |-
  An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the
  Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which
  might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
  dereference and system crash).

  debian/bwh: |-
    There was already a null check before dereferencing the pointer.
    No security impact.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    This CVE is disputed due to a lack of security impact. I've reviewed
     all of our current kernels and have verified that none of them attempt to
     dereference a NULL new_ra pointer.
