description: |-
  An issue was discovered in drm_load_edid_firmware in
  drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is
  an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a
  denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).

    Root can set a long string and maybe (but probably not) cause a
    null pointer dereference.  No security impact.
