    Root can set a long string and maybe (but probably not) cause a
    null pointer dereference.  No security impact.

    There's no security impact here as there's no chance of a NULL
     pointer derefence. I've requested that MITRE reject this CVE.
    I've reviewed our Disco, Cosmic, Bionic, and Xenial kernels. There's
     no security impact here so we'll ignore this issue.
