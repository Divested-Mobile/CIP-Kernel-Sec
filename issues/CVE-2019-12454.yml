description: |-
  An issue was discovered in wcd9335_codec_enable_dec in
  sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It uses
  kstrndup instead of kmemdup_nul, which allows attackers to have an
  unspecified impact via unknown vectors.

    There's no security impact here from what I can tell. I've requested
     that MITRE reject this CVE.
  bwh: kstrndup() was the correct function to use here.
ignore:
  all: Invalid
