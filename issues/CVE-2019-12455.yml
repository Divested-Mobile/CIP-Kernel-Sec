description: |-
  An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in
  drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is
  an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to
  cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).

  debian/bwh: |-
    Memory allocation failure in init code results in null pointer
    dereference.  No security impact.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    This issue has a questionable security impact. The memory allocation
     is in the module init path and it isn't clear if it is actually vulnerable to
     an attacker.
    This issue only affects kernels built with CONFIG_CLK_SUNXI_CLOCKS
     enabled. Ubuntu does not enable that config option in any kernels.
