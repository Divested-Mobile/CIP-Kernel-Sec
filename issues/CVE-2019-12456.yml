description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in _ctl_ioctl_main in
  drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It
  allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact by changing the value of ioc_number between two
  kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability.
