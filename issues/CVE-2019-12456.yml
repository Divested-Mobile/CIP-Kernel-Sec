  An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in _ctl_ioctl_main in
  drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It
  allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact by changing the value of ioc_number between two
  kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability.

  bwh: |
    The double-fetched value is not used after the second fetch, so
    although it seems like a good idea to guard against a possible
    TOCTTOU issue I don't think there was an actual vulnerability
    here.

    There seems to be no security impact as the ioc_number is never used
     after the "double fetch"
