description: |-
  An issue was discovered in dlpar_parse_cc_property in
  arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.6.
  There is an unchecked kstrdup of prop->name, which might allow an attacker
  to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).

  debian/bwh: |-
    This is a potential null pointer dereference that looks like it can
    only be invoked by root or the hypervisor.  Probably no security impact.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: Ubuntu kernels that are not built for IBM POWER are unaffected
