description: |-
  An issue was discovered in get_vdev_port_node_info in
  arch/sparc/kernel/mdesc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.6. There is an
  unchecked kstrdup_const of node_info->vdev_port.name, which might allow an
  attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
  crash).

    This is a potential null pointer dereference that looks like it can
    only be invoked by root or the hypervisor.  Probbaly no security impact.
