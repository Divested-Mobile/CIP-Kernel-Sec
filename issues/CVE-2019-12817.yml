description: |-
  It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly separate certain
  memory mappings when creating new userspace processes on 64-bit Power
  (ppc64el) systems. A local attacker could use this to access memory contents
  or cause memory corruption of other processes on the system.

  debian/carnil: |-
    bug introduced with f384796c40dc ("powerpc/mm: Add support for
    handling > 512TB address in SLB miss") (4.17-rc1).
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    The vulnerability was introduced in upstream kernel version v4.17
    This issue only affects ppc64el. The 32-bit powerpc architecture is
     not affected.
    Power8, Power7, Power6, Power5, and older 64-bit Power systems are
     affected by default
    Power9 LPARs running under PowerVM are affected by default. This
     issue does not affect Power9 bare metal systems by default. Power9 bare metal
     is only affected when "disable_radix" is specified as a kernel boot option.
