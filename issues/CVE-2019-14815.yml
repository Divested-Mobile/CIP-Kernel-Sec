    Introduced in 4.10 by commit 113630b581d6 "mwifiex: vendor_ie length
    check for parse WMM IEs".
  Debian-carnil: |-
    The bounds-check in mwifiex_set_wmm_paramsare still applied as
    well in older versions e.g. 4.9.194. Put the state again in
    needed for 4.9-stretch-security but just to recheck if this is
    really not needed to track for CVE-2019-14815.
