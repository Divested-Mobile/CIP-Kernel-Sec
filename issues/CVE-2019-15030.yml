    Commit fixes f48e91e87e67 ("powerpc/tm: Fix FP and VMX register
    corruption") but that commit was backported as well to older
    versions than 4.12, so the CC to stable@v.k.o does not seem
    completely correct. It was included as well in 4.9.30.
    Fix can be defered to point release when updating to new
    upstream stable versions as we disable
    CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM since 5.2.6-1 (sid), 4.19.67-2
    (buster) and 4.9.184-1 (stretch).
