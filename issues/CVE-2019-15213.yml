    This is supposed to be fixed by commit 6cf97230cd5f "media: dvb:
    usb: fix use after free in dvb_usb_device_exit", but that won't fix
    the syzkaller report it claims to.  The KASAN output shows an 8-byte
    access to memory that was allocated in dw2102_probe(), apparently by
    the statement "s421 = kmemdup(...)".  But it was also freed by
    dw2102_probe(), so d->desc was already a dangling pointer before
    dvb_usb_device_exit() was called.
    The name strings seem to be static data that are only freed when
    the module containing them is unloaded.  Which dvb_usb_device_exit()
    doesn't do.
    Introduced in 4.19 by commit 299c7007e936 "media: dw2102: Fix
    memleak on sequence of probes".

    Setting priority to low since this issue requires a malicious USB
     device to be inserted into the system
    Ben Hutchings noticed that commit 6cf97230cd5f ("media: dvb: usb: fix
     use after free in dvb_usb_device_exit"), which is mentioned in the CVE
     references for this issue, likely doesn't fix the problem. See the lore
     reference above for details. I think Ben is correct and have adjusted our
     break-fix metadata to use the break commit that he pointed out.
