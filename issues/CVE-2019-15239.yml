description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was
  properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the
  earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was
  potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by
  backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection
  and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free
  conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege
  escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use
  4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before
  4.14.139.

comments:
  Debian-bwh: |-
    Introduced by backports of commit 7f582b248d0a
    "tcp: purge write queue in tcp_connect_init()" to stable.
    Upstream avoided this issue due to the earlier commit
    75c119afe14f "tcp: implement rb-tree based retransmit queue".
  Debian-carnil: |-
    As pointed out by Ben, in https://lore.kernel.org/stable/41a61a2f87691d2bc839f26cdfe6f5ff2f51e472.camel@decadent.org.uk/
    the issue got already fixed by dbbf2d1e4077 ("tcp: reset
    sk_send_head in tcp_write_queue_purge") in 4.14.32, which got
    backported to 4.4.187 and 4.9.187.
