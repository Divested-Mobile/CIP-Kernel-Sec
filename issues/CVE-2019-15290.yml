  masami: This CVE is rejected.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    Setting priority to negligible since this simple DoS requires a
     malicious USB device to be inserted into the system
    As of 2019-08-26, there's no upstream fix.
    I think this may be a duplicate of CVE-2019-15098
ignore:
  all: This CVE is rejected
