    Introduced in 4.18 by commit eccb4422cf97 "smb3: Add ftrace tracepoints
    for improved SMB3 debugging".
  debian/carnil: |-
    Needs double check if correctly fixed in stable branches as the
    CVE entry noticed that it was not correctly fixed in 5.0.10 for
    instance and introduced further issue. Same issue is present as
    well for the 4.19 series where the issue needed a followup in
    4.19.38.
