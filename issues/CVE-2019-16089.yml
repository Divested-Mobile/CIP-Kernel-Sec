  bwh: |
    nla_nest_start() will only fail if there is insufficient space in
    the given skb.  This does seem to be possible in theory, as the
    size nbd_genl_status() requests does not account for the size of
    nested attribute headers.  In practice skb sizes are cache-line-
    aligned and that will probably avoid failure at this point.

    Introduced in 4.12 by commit 47d902b90a32 "nbd: add a status netlink
    command".  Probably not exploitable in most configurations.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: fix has not landed upstream as of 2020-04-22
