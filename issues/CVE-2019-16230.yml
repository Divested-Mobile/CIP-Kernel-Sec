  debian/bwh: |-
    Requires memory allocation failure during device probe, so unlikely to
    be exploitable, and then it's only a local DoS.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    This issue will not be addressed by upstream, and has
      been disputed because work queue allocation happens during device
      initialization and causing it to fail is unlikely to be attacker
      controllable. Because of this, Canonical will not be addressing
      this issue, either.
    the linux-kernel-tracker lists 81de29d842ccb776c0f77aa3e2b11b07fff0c0e2
      as the fix, but that is actually the fix for CVE-2019-16229
  ubuntu/tyhicks: As of 2019-09-27, there is no upstream fix available
