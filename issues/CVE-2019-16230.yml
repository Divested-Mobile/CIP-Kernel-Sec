  debian/bwh: |-
    Requires memory allocation failure during device probe, so unlikely to
    be exploitable, and then it's only a local DoS.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    as of 2020.05.24, still unfixed upstream, mistakenly
      believed to be addressed by the fix for CVE-2019-16229
    it's possible this was introduced in
      a37cfa8be20c5571ca82fac38441592040a2d071
    issue can only occur on device initialization, which is
      usually during boot and not attacker controllable
    the linux-kernel-tracker lists 81de29d842ccb776c0f77aa3e2b11b07fff0c0e2
      as the fix, but that is actually the fix for CVE-2019-16229
  ubuntu/tyhicks: As of 2019-09-27, there is no upstream fix available
introduced-by:
  mainline: [fa7f517cb26eb1a1a1f0baffcced39f6c3ec3337]
