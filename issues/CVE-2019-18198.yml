description: |-
  In the Linux 5.3 kernel before 5.3.4, a reference count usage error in
  the fib6_rule_suppress() function in the fib6 suppression feature of
  net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c, when handling the FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF flag, can be
  exploited by a local attacker to corrupt memory, aka CID-ca7a03c41753.

    Fixes 7d9e5f422150 ("ipv6: convert major tx path to use
    RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF") which was only introduced in 5.3-rc1
    and not backported to other branches. Intrestingly though the
    commit was still applied/backported as well in/to 5.2.19.
  szlin: Since CIP only supports kernel 4.4 and 4.19, there is no impact for CIP member
  ubuntu/sbeattie: affects 5.3 kernels only
