    This is a 4.4.x specific issue as per
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/18/378
  ubuntu/PHLin: |-
    this patch was targeted for 4.4 only, from the author's comment:
      Upstream does not use tc->t_sock in the second loop after below two patches.
      afb4164d91c7 ("RDS: TCP: Refactor connection destruction to handle multiple paths") and
      2d746c93b6e5 ("rds: tcp: remove redundant function rds_tcp_conn_paths_destroy()")
