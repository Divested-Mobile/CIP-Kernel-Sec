description: |-
  A memory leak in the ccp_run_sha_cmd() function in
  drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka
  CID-128c66429247.

comments:
  Debian-bwh: |-
    The SHA type is already validated at the top of the function, so this
    is "fixing" an unreachable error path.
  Debian-carnil: Fix not yet in Linus' tree.
ignore:
  all: Not a real issue
