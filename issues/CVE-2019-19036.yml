description: |-
  btrfs_root_node in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.12
  allows a NULL pointer dereference because rcu_dereference(root->node) can
  be zero.

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    I think this affects 4.9 but the fix depends on commits going back
    to at least 581c1760415c "btrfs: Validate child tree block's level
    and first key".
  debian/carnil: |-
    This is a good candidate and is included in 5.4-rc1. It was
    futhermore backported to 5.3.4, 5.2.19 and 4.19.129, where the
    5.3.4 fixing information would as well match what is available
    from the Red Hat bugzilla.
  debian/jmm: Fixed by 62fdaa52a3d00a875da771719b6dc537ca79fce1 ?
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    likely addressed by the btrfs write time tree-checker, which
      would mean it is addressed for kernels back through 4.4.x
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    Exploiting this vulnerability requires a crafted filesystem image to
     be mounted
  wens: |-
    Based on comments from SUSE bugzilla, the tree checker rejects
    rootid == 0. This check was introduced in commit 259ee7754b67
    ("btrfs: tree-checker: Add ROOT_ITEM check") in v5.4.
