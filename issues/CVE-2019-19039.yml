  __btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel through
  5.3.12 calls btrfs_print_leaf in a certain ENOENT case, which allows local
  users to obtain potentially sensitive information about register values via
  the dmesg program.

    The actual issue seems to be that it's possible to trigger a
    WARN(), which logs a register dump.  That may reveal sensitive
    information if the kernel log is not restricted (or may result in
    a panic, hence denial-of-service).

  linux-4.4.y-cip-rt: No member enables btrfs
