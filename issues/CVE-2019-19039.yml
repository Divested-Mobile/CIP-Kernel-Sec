description: |-
  __btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel through
  5.3.12 calls btrfs_print_leaf in a certain ENOENT case, which allows local
  users to obtain potentially sensitive information about register values via
  the dmesg program.

    The reporter describes this as an information leak because a WARN()
    causes register contents to be logged.  This is mitigated on stretch
    onward because we restrict access to the kernel log by default.
    However this can still be a denial-of-service if panic_on_warn is
    enabled.

    The actual issue seems to be that it's possible to trigger a
    WARN(), which logs a register dump.  That may reveal sensitive
    information if the kernel log is not restricted (or may result in
    a panic, hence denial-of-service).
