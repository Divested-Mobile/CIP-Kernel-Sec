description: |-
  A memory leak in the __ipmi_bmc_register() function in
  drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11
  allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by
  triggering ida_simple_get() failure, aka CID-4aa7afb0ee20.

  Debian-carnil: Fixed as well in 5.4.15
