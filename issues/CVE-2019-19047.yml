description: |-
  A memory leak in the mlx5_fw_fatal_reporter_dump() function in
  drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/health.c in the Linux kernel before
  5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
  by triggering mlx5_crdump_collect() failures, aka CID-c7ed6d0183d5.
