  A memory leak in the i2400m_op_rfkill_sw_toggle() function in
  drivers/net/wimax/i2400m/op-rfkill.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.11
  allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka
  CID-6f3ef5c25cc7.

    WiMax is a dead protocol and already flagged as not supportable in
