description: |-
  A memory leak in the fsl_lpspi_probe() function in
  drivers/spi/spi-fsl-lpspi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering
  pm_runtime_get_sync() failures, aka CID-057b8945f78f.

  Debian-bwh: This is a potential memory leak on probe, which is not a vulnerability.
