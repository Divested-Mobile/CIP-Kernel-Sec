description: |-
  Memory leaks in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c in the Linux
  kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  consumption) by triggering wait_for_completion_timeout() failures. This
  affects the htc_config_pipe_credits() function, the htc_setup_complete()
  function, and the htc_connect_service() function, aka CID-853acf7caf10.

    I suspect that the "fix" for this actually introduces a
    use-after-free, since the command might still complete
    after the driver gives up waiting.
