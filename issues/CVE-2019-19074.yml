description: |-
  A memory leak in the ath9k_wmi_cmd() function in
  drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/wmi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11
  allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka
  CID-728c1e2a05e4.

    I suspect that the "fix" for this actually introduces a
    use-after-free, since the command might still complete
    after the driver gives up waiting.
