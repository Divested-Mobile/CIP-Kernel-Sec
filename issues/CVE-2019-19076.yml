  Debian-bwh: |-
    Introduced in 5.0 by commit 174ab544e3bc "nfp: abm: add cls_u32
    offload for simple band classification".
  Debian-carnil: |-
    Commit 78beef629fd9 ("nfp: abm: fix memory leak in
    nfp_abm_u32_knode_replace") was later on reverted as the
    commit does not fix anything and resulted as well in bogus
    CVE-2019-19076.
