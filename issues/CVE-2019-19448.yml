description: In the Linux kernel 5.0.21 and 5.3.11, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem
  image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead
  to a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space in fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c because
  the pointer to a left data structure can be the same as the pointer to a right data
  structure.

  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    it's asserted that the btrfs enhanced tree-checker should
     address this issue; this was backported to at least the 4.15 kernels.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    Exploiting this vulnerability requires a crafted filesystem image to
     be mounted
