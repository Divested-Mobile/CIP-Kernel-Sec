description: In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image
  can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in f2fs_build_segment_manager in fs/f2fs/segment.c,
  related to init_min_max_mtime in fs/f2fs/segment.c (because the second argument
  to get_seg_entry is not validated).

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    The loop in init_min_max_mtime() has not changed between
    4.9 and 5.17-rc4, and there don't appear to be any checks
    that main_segments is exactly divisible by segs_per_sec,
    so all branches are affected.
  masami: Fixed in 5.10-rc1.
