description: |-
  In the Linux kernel before 5.3.11, sound/core/timer.c has a use-after-free
  caused by erroneous code refactoring, aka CID-e7af6307a8a5. This is related
  to snd_timer_open and snd_timer_close_locked. The timeri variable was
  originally intended to be for a newly created timer instance, but was used
  for a different purpose after refactoring.
