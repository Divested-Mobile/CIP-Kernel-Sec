description: In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image,
  performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free
  in __mutex_lock in kernel/locking/mutex.c. This is related to mutex_can_spin_on_owner
  in kernel/locking/mutex.c, __btrfs_qgroup_free_meta in fs/btrfs/qgroup.c, and btrfs_insert_delayed_items
  in fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c.

  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    upstream developer asserts in suse bug that the enhanced
       btrfs tree-checker addresses this issue, which was backported to at
       least the 4.15 kernel.
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: As of 2020-01-09, no upstream fix is available
  wens: Exploiting this vulnerability requires a crafted filesystem image to be mounted
