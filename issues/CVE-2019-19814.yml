description: In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image
  can cause __remove_dirty_segment slab-out-of-bounds write access because an array
  is bounded by the number of dirty types (8) but the array index can exceed this.

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    __remove_dirty_segment() needs to range-check the variable t
    in the same way __locate_dirty_segment() does.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: As of 2020-01-09, no upstream fix is available
  wens: Exploiting this vulnerability requires a crafted filesystem image to be mounted
ignore:
