description: In the Linux kernel 5.0.0-rc7 (as distributed in ubuntu/linux.git on
  kernel.ubuntu.com), mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image and performing some
  operations can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in ttm_put_pages in drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_page_alloc.c.
  This is related to the vmwgfx or ttm module.
