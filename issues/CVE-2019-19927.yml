description: In the Linux kernel 5.0.0-rc7 (as distributed in ubuntu/linux.git on
  kernel.ubuntu.com), mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image and performing some
  operations can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in ttm_put_pages in drivers/gpu/drm/ttm/ttm_page_alloc.c.
  This is related to the vmwgfx or ttm module.

comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    This is related to THP (transparent huge page) support which was
    added in 4.15.
  debian/carnil: |-
    One of the commits, a66477b0efe5 ("drm/ttm: fix out-of-bounds
    read in ttm_put_pages() v2") was as well backported to 4.19.37.
    What is relevant to the supported branches to be backported?
    All three commits need to be applied, cf.
