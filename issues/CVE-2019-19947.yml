    Commit fixes 7259124eac7d ("can: kvaser_usb: Split driver into
    kvaser_usb_core.c and kvaser_usb_leaf.c") in 4.19-rc1, but this
    was a split of the codebasis so the issue might be present
    before as well.
  wens: |-
    This issue was present from the beginning since the driver was
    introduced.
