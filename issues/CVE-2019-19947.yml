  Debian-bwh: |-
    Introduced in 3.8 by commit 080f40a6fa28 "can: kvaser_usb: Add support
    for Kvaser CAN/USB devices".
  Debian-carnil: |-
    Commit fixes 7259124eac7d ("can: kvaser_usb: Split driver into
    kvaser_usb_core.c and kvaser_usb_leaf.c") in 4.19-rc1, but this
    was a split of the codebasis so the issue might be present
    before as well.
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    I don't think that the Fixes tag in patch is correct and that the
     info leaks were possible since the initial inclusion of the driver
  wens: |-
    This issue was present from the beginning since the driver was
    introduced.
