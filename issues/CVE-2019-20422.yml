description: |-
  In the Linux kernel before 5.3.4, fib6_rule_lookup in net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c
  mishandles the RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF flag in a reference-count decision,
  leading to (for example) a crash that was identified by syzkaller, aka
  CID-7b09c2d052db.

    rule lookup logic") which is only present in 5.3-rc1 onwards.
