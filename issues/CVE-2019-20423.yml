description: |-
  In the Lustre file system before 2.12.3, the ptlrpc module has a buffer
  overflow and panic due to the lack of validation for specific fields of
  packets sent by a client. The function target_handle_connect() mishandles a
  certain size value when a client connects to a server, because of an
  integer signedness error.
