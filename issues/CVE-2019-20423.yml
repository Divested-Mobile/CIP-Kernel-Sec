description: |-
  In the Lustre file system before 2.12.3, the ptlrpc module has a buffer
  overflow and panic due to the lack of validation for specific fields of
  packets sent by a client. The function target_handle_connect() mishandles a
  certain size value when a client connects to a server, because of an
  integer signedness error.

  ubuntu/cascardo: |-
    The affected code was never part of linux, as the staging driver
      was only the client side.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    lustre was removed from the upstream staging tree in 4.18
      (be65f9ed267fd7d8b3146b7c4be9ecdd3e0aa3ed)

    Lustre file system was added to staging in v3.11 and removed in v4.18.
    Confirmed the code path in question does not exist in the staging driver.
