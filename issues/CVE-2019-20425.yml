description: |-
  In the Lustre file system before 2.12.3, the ptlrpc module has an
  out-of-bounds access and panic due to the lack of validation for specific
  fields of packets sent by a client. In the function lustre_msg_string,
  there is no validation of a certain length value derived from
  lustre_msg_buflen_v2.
