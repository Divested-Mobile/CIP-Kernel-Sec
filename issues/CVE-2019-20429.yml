description: |-
  In the Lustre file system before 2.12.3, the ptlrpc module has an
  out-of-bounds read and panic (via a modified lm_bufcount field) due to the
  lack of validation for specific fields of packets sent by a client. This is
  caused by interaction between sptlrpc_svc_unwrap_request and
  lustre_msg_hdr_size_v2.
