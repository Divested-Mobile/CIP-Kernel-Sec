  debian/bwh: |-
    The proposed fix notes that the daemon can be killed off through
    the fusectl filesystem, but the kill command or service shutdown
    won't work.
  ubuntu/jdstrand: |-
    Patch not available, unclear if >=5.6.12 has the fix or if the range
     is wrong. All distros consider this minor.
