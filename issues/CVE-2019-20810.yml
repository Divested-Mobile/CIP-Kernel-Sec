  debian/bwh: |-
    This has minimal security imapct since it is triggered by
    an error during device probing.
    In 3.16, this driver is in drivers/staging/media/go7007.
  wens: |-
    Ubuntu lists commit a4f2473d39eb ("ALSA: atmel: Convert to snd_card_new()
    with a device pointer"), however this is not the correct conversion
    commit, nor does the conversion change the requirement of calling
    snd_card_free(). The call was missing from day one when the driver was
    introduced in v2.6.28-rc1. Fixed in v5.6-rc1.
