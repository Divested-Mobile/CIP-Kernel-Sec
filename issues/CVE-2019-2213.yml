  debian/bwh: |-
    For branches older than 4.20, the second hunk should be applied
    to binder_thread_write() instead of binder_free_buf().
    For branches older than 4.14, the first hunk should be applied to
    binder_pop_transaction() instead of binder_free_transaction().
    It's not clear how the locking should be done for branches older
    than 4.14 though.
