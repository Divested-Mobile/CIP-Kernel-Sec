  Debian-carnil: |-
    Issue present since 0b9f6c4615c99 ("x86/kvm: Support the vCPU
    preemption check") in 4.10-rc1. But might need double-check.
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    This issue does not affect default installations of Ubuntu as the
     paravirtual TLB flush feature in KVM is not enabled by default. The QEMU CPU
     feature "kvm-pv-tlb-flush" is used to enable paravirtual TLB flush.
    It is thought that issue does not affect Intel processors supporting
     Process-Context Identifiers (PCIDs). You can check support for PCIDs on
     systems with Intel processors by running "grep pcid /proc/cpuinfo" and
     verifying that "pcid" shows as one of the flags.
