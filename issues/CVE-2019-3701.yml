description: |-
  An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux
  kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise
  logical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. Because
  of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the
  data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw
  manipulated outgoing frames. This is related to cgw_csum_xor_rel. An
  unprivileged user can trigger a system crash (general protection fault).

    unprivileged user namespaces might be needed to exploit the bug,
    but needs to be checked.
  Ubuntu-tyhicks: |-
    The original CVE description that states that an unprivileged user
     can trigger a system crash is incorrect. Only the root user, from the init
     namespace, can trigger the system crash. Therefore, we'll prioritize this
     issue as negligible.
