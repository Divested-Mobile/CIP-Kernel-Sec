description: |-
  An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux
  kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise
  logical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. Because
  of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the
  data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw
  manipulated outgoing frames. This is related to cgw_csum_xor_rel. A
  privileged user can trigger a system crash (general protection fault).

    unprivileged user namespaces might be needed to exploit the bug,
    but needs to be checked.
  ubuntu/tyhicks: |-
    The original CVE description that states that an unprivileged user
     can trigger a system crash is incorrect. Only the root user, from the init
     namespace, can trigger the system crash. Therefore, we'll prioritize this
     issue as negligible.

    Only the global root user can trigger this bug and the result is a
    crash. This doesn't seem to have a security impact.
