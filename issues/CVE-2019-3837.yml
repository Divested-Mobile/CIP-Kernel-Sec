description: |-
  It was found that the net_dma code in tcp_recvmsg() in the 2.6.32 kernel as
  shipped in RHEL6 is thread-unsafe. So an unprivileged multi-threaded
  userspace application calling recvmsg() for the same network socket in
  parallel executed on ioatdma-enabled hardware with net_dma enabled can leak
  the memory, crash the host leading to a denial-of-service or cause a random
  memory corruption.
