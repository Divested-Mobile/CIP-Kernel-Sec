    Based on the proposed fixes, I don't believe there is a memory
    leak.  The issue is that the cgroup memory controller's kmem
    limits didn't affect SCTP sockets.  Since it is already usual to
    restrict the socket types allowed in a container, I don't consider
    this an important issue.

    As of 2019-04-01, a patch series that addresses this issue has been
     submitted for upstream review but it has not yet been ACK'ed or merged.
    As of 2019-04-09, the patch series is still in the same state.
