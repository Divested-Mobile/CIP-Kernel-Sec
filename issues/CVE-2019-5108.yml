  Debian-carnil: |-
    The Cisco TALOS report talks about "prior to mainline 5.3" but
    unclear yet (to me) where the issue has been fixed or if that
    only reflects the state when the advisory was written.
fixed-by:
  mainline: [3e493173b7841259a08c5c8e5cbe90adb349da7e]
ignore:
  4.4.y-rt: No member enables MAC80211
