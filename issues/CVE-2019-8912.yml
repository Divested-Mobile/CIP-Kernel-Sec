    This is a followup fix for
    6d8c50dcb029872b298eea68cc6209c866fd3e14 (4.18-rc1) which was
    CVE-2018-12232. CVE-2018-12232 was affecting only 4.10-rc1
    onwards, quoting the note in CVE-2018-12232.
    Issue introduced with 86741ec25462 ("net: core: Add a UID field
    to struct sock.").
    There might be a more generic follow-up as per

    NVD has published CVSS metrics that state that the attack vector is
     "Network" which results in a CRITICAL CVSS score but that does not match
     Ubuntu's assessment. The attack vector is "Local" since AF_ALG is a address
     family that strictly operates locally between a userspace process and the
     kernel crypto API and the attack requires a specific sequence of operations
     to be performed on the file descriptor that represents the socket.
    This has been addressed in a more generic manner, to fix
     other network families, by this commit in the net tree:
