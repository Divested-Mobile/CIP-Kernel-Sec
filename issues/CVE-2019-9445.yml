  Debian-bwh: |-
    The CVE description mentions an "out-of bounds read", so the most
    likely fix seemed to be commit 64beba0558fc "f2fs: sanity check of
    xattr entry size".  However that addresses CVE-2019-9245.  The
    other candidate I could see was commit 720db068634c "f2fs: check
    if file namelen exceeds max value".
    Apparently introduced in 3.8 when f2fs was added.
  Debian-carnil: Not fully clear (to me) which specific commit is meant.
