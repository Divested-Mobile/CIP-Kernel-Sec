description: KVM guest's XCR0 is used in host after MCE

    Branches before 4.14 should probably apply commit b060ca3b2e9e
    "kvm: vmx: Handle VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME failure properly" first, if
    only to avoid conflicts.  But this in turn needs further fixes.
  Debian-carnil: |-
    In a821bab2d1ee ("KVM: VMX: Move VMX specific files to a "vmx"
    subdirectory") in 5.0-rc1 file arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c was moved to
    subdirectory arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c so backport to 4.19 and
    older need to account for that.
