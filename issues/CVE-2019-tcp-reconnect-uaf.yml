  Debian-bwh: |-
    Apparently introduced by backports of commit 7f582b248d0a
    "tcp: purge write queue in tcp_connect_init()" to stable.
    Upstream avoided this issue due to the earlier commit
    75c119afe14f "tcp: implement rb-tree based retransmit queue".
    This issue is currently embargoed.
