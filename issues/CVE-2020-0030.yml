    Although the upstream commit has been backported to 4.9, it
    depends on commit 7a4408c6bd3e "binder: make sure accesses to
    proc/thread are safe" which has not.
  debian/carnil: |-
    For tracking, this was in 4.9.196 with
    b6c6212514fe9f2387fc6677181028d4a9ae20c7 commit in linux-4.9.y
    branch
  ubuntu/cascardo: |-
    This seems to be like that since binder was added to the
     kernel, ie., binder would allow the thread to be freed while its wait
     member was still in the epoll waitqueue.
    Description was taken from patch's comment, as it describes
     the specific race condition that makes this different from CVE-2019-2215.
     I added the first sentence which would be a fair description of both
     this CVE and CVE-2019-2215.
