  Load value injection in some Intel(R) Processors utilizing speculative
  execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information
  disclosure via a side channel with local access. The list of affected
  products is provided in intel-sa-00334:

  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    only affects processors from Intel
    primary impact is for SGX users. May need toolchain updates
      for applications that are targeted for use in SGX enclaves.
    most Ubuntu kernels do not support or have SGX drivers
      available, and so are not affected. The linux-azure kernels do have
      SGX enabled (as of
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-azure/+bug/1844245 )
      and thus the Ubuntu Kernel team is investigating further. The
      guidance that we have received so far from Intel indicates that it is
      only SGX applications that need mitigations.

  all: SGX driver is out-of-tree module
