  debian/bwh: |-
    Disputed - it actually requires the administrator to do strange
    things.
  ubuntu/cascardo: |-
    Steve Grubb disputes the issue here as killing auditd requires
     root. 5b52330bbfe63b3305765354d6046c9f7f89c011 could be considered a fix
     and even mentions a reported race that lead to the commit, but no
     references.
ignore:
  all: This CVE is rejected
