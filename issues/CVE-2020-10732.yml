  Debian-bwh: |-
    The leak appears to have been introduced for x86 in 4.8 by
    commit 91c3dba7dbc1 "x86/fpu/xstate: Fix PTRACE frames for
    XSAVES".  A comparison of register sections in core dump
    under different Debian kernels agrees with that, as does
    @grsecurity (further down the thread).  Some other
    architectures are affected though.
  Debian-carnil: |-
    Proposed fix has been accepted in linux-next tree, as per
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1831399#c15
  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    original report claimed this was introduced in
      4206d3aa1978e44f58bfa4e1c9d8d35cbf19c187, but further investigation
      by Jann Horn makes the case that 91c3dba7dbc1 is where the real
      problem is introduced.
