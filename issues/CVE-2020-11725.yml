  Debian-carnil: |-
    Comment from above twitter reference: "the count = info->owner
    does not seem right as owner is supposed to be a pid.". Issue
    has been disputed to be correct by Takashi Iwai.
  Ubuntu-cascardo: |-
    This issue is disputed by upstream, info->owner is used
     intentionally for that specific API.
