description: |-
  In the Linux kernel through 5.6.7 on the s390 platform, code execution may
  occur because of a race condition, as demonstrated by code in
  enable_sacf_uaccess in arch/s390/lib/uaccess.c that fails to protect
  against a concurrent page table upgrade, aka CID-3f777e19d171. A crash
  could also occur.
