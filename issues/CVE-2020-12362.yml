  debian/bwh: |-
    Let's treat it as both firmware and kernel, similar to CPU issues
    that need both microcode and kernel changes.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Claimed to affect versions before Linux kernel version 5.5.
    Not adding fixed versions as wanting to try to pinpoint the
    respective needed commits for correct tracking.
    Per Intel, this was fixed by a firmware update. v49.0.1 of the
    firmware is required. The new firmware requires a kernel patch
    https://git.kernel.org/linus/c784e5249e773689e38d2bc1749f08b986621a26
    So might not be treaded as Linux issue itself.
