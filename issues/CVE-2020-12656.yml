  debian/carnil: Bug triggered only at module reloading / rebinding.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    upstream generally treats module unload as an unsafe
      operation, which may explain a lack of progress in addressing the
      issue.
  wens: |-
    commit f45db2b909c7 ("sunrpc: check that domain table is empty at module unload.")
    listed as a fix by Debian isn't strictly needed. It was not backported to stable
    kernels while the other two were.
