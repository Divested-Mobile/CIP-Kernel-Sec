    no progress as of 2020.10.26, debian bug had a proposed patch
      that was shown to be not correct.
    Looks to affect Mellanox driver?
    Requires root privileges, and does not allow attacker to
      target specific memory.
  wens: Based on comments to the posted patch, the problem might be misidentified.
