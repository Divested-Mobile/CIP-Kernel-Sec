    CVE-2020-12351, CVE-2020-12352 and CVE-2020-24490 are three
    issues covered by a set of commits/patches sent upstream but
    there is no clear association from the CVEs to the commits. So
    duplicate this entry for now to all three CVEs.
    The commits are:
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20200806181714.3216076-1-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20200806181714.3216076-2-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20200806181714.3216076-3-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20200806181714.3216076-4-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/
    which are not yet in mainline, and
    a2ec905d1e16 ("Bluetooth: fix kernel oops in
    store_pending_adv_report") which is in 5.8 (and which was
    backported to 5.7.13, 5.4.56 and 4.19.137). This commit fixes
    c215e9397b00 ("Bluetooth: Process extended ADV report event")
    which is in 4.19-rc1 but not backported to other stable series.
    The "fixed version" information in INTEL-SA-00435 is thus as
    well contradictory as it mentions the issue to be fixed in 5.9
    or later.
  ubuntu: |-
    sbeattie| This issue affected kernels 4.18 and later; as such Ubuntu
      20.04's 5.4 kernel was fixed around 2020/09/21, before the advisory
      was issued.
    sbeattie| it is asserted that b2cc9761f144e8ef714be8c590603073b80ddc13
      made the vulnerability accessible.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    it's not clear if
        https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20201016180956.707681-1-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/
      is needed as well.
  wens: |-
    The four patches are already in net-next as of 2020-10-14 and should hit
    mainline soon. As far as I can tell, ("Bluetooth: A2MP: Fix not
    initializing all members") fixes commits going all the way back to
    3.6, when A2MP was added.
    Regarding the culprit commits, the first commit is fixed by a2ec905d1e16
    ("Bluetooth: fix kernel oops in store_pending_adv_report"); the next
    nine are the various "not fully initialized stack variables"; the last
    two are the sk_filter and BT_HS ones, respectfully.
