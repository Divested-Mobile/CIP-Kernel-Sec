description: |-
  The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received
  fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under
  the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames
  encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary
  network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
