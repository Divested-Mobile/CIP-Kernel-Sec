description: |-
  The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments
  of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to
  decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and
  the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
