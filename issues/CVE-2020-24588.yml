description: |-
  The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU
  flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices
  that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of
  802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.
