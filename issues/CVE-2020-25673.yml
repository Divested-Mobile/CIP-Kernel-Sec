  debian/bwh: Not sure how far back this goes, but 4.9 seems to have the issue
  debian/carnil: |-
    Possibly 4b5db93e7f2a ("nfc: Avoid endless loops caused by
    repeated llcp_sock_connect()") is the only part of the problem
    which can be properly fixed? That commit would then be in 5.12-rc7
    and was backported to 5.10.30, 4.19.187 and 4.9.267. Other seem to
    have it classified as such and follow Ubuntu's tracking.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    unfixed upstream as of 2021-03-16
    possibly addressed by 4b5db93e7f2afbdfe3b78e37879a85290187e6f1
