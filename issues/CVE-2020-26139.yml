description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP)
  forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet
  successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected
  Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected
  clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected
  clients.
