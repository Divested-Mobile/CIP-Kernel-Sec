  debian/bwh: |-
    I don't think this bug was present in mac80211, but individual
    drivers or firmware might be affected.  The same issue was found
    earlier in some vendor drivers which were assigned
    CVE-2019-18989, CVE-2019-18990, and CVE-2019-18991:

  debian/carnil: Needs to be checked if this really has a fix in Linux.
