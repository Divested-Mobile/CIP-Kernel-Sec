  An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for
  AWUS036H. The Wi-Fi implementation does not verify the Message Integrity
  Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can abuse this
  to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support
  the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol.
