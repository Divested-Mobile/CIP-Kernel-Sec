  An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 1030.36.604 for
  AWUS036ACH. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept fragmented
  plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this
  to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration.
