description: |-
  An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP,
  WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long
  as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header
  for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets
  independent of the network configuration.
