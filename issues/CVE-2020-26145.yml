  An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP,
  WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast
  fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented
  frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets
  independent of the network configuration.
