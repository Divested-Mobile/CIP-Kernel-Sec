description: |-
  An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WPA,
  WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments with non-consecutive
  packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected
  fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends
  fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol
  is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by design.
