description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and
  WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were
  sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets
  and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented
  frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.
