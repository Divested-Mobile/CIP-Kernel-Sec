  debian/bwh: |-
    This is only relevant to kernel versions that support the
    UEFI Secure Boot key store and/or are themselves signed.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    as of 2021-03-11, patches are in linux-next and have been
      submitted to linus for merging, but seems to have stalled there.
  ubuntu/seth-arnold: The patch doesn't appear to be in Linus's tree as of 2020-10-02
