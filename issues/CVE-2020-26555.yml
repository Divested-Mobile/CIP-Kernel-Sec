    Fedora claims this was fixed along with CVE-2020-26558 in
    5.12.7, which implies the upstream fix is commit 6d19628f539f
    "Bluetooth: SMP: Fail if remote and local public keys are
    identical". But it's not clear to me that that commit
    addresses this issue too.
    Intel claims to have addressed this for their Bluetooth
    adapters in a firmware update.

  mainline: [6d19628f539fccf899298ff02ee4c73e4bf6df3f]
