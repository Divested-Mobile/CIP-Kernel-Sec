description: Mesh Provisioning in the Bluetooth Mesh profile 1.0 and 1.0.1 may permit
  a nearby device (without possession of the AuthValue used in the provisioning protocol)
  to determine the AuthValue via a brute-force attack (unless the AuthValue is sufficiently
  random and changed each time).

    According to the SUSE bugzilla comment 5, Linux kernel cannot do anything
    to this bug. Userspace application disables mesh service to migigate this CVE.
