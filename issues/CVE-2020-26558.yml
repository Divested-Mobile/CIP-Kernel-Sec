description: Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification
  2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey
  used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the
  public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially
  permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device
  using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines
  the Passkey value one bit at a time.
