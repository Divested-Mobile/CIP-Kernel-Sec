description: "Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning in the Bluetooth Mesh profile 1.0 and 1.0.1\
  \ may permit a nearby device (participating in the provisioning protocol) to identify\
  \ the AuthValue used given the Provisioner\u2019s public key, and the confirmation\
  \ number and nonce provided by the provisioning device. This could permit a device\
  \ without the AuthValue to complete provisioning without brute-forcing the AuthValue."
