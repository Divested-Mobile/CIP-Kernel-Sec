    From contact with the Android security team we only know:
    Android Security team did some research on the 4.14.y series
    which they use in this product and found that apparently a code
    change between 4.14.170 and 4.14.180 fixed the issue. It was
    though not clear exactly which change resolved the
    vulnerability. For 4.14.y it is believed that all versions from
    4.14.180 up are fixed. This still leaves open which is/are the
    upstream commits adressing the issue and so to determine the
    state for the other branches.
