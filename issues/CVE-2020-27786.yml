description: |-
  It was found that the raw midi kernel driver does not protect against
  concurrent access which leads to a use-after-free in
  snd_rawmidi_kernel_read1() and snd_rawmidi_kernel_write1() in rawmidi.c
  file.  A malicious local attacker could possibly use this for privilege
  escalation.
