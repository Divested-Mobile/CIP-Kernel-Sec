description: |-
  A use-after-free flaw was found in kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c in Linux
  kernel. There was a race problem in trace_open and resize of cpu buffer
  running parallely on different cpus, may cause a denial of service problem
  (DOS). This flaw could even allow a local attacker with special user
  privilege to a kernel information leak threat.

    Commit fixes b23d7a5f4a07a ("ring-buffer: speed up buffer
    resets by avoiding synchronize_rcu for each CPU") in v5.9-rc1
    and not backported to other series.
    Actually it is not the cause of the bug but a commit which
    should have been "Depends-on", cf. https://lore.kernel.org/stable/20210121140951.2a554a5e@gandalf.local.home/
  wens: Introduced in v5.9-rc1; fixed in v5.10-rc1.
