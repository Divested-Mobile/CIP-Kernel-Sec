description: |-
  An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6. It
  unsafely handles the root directory during path lookups, and thus a process
  inside a mount namespace can escape to unintended filesystem locations, aka
  CID-ff002b30181d.

    sbeattie| asserted that the issue affects 5.3 and newer, but not
      clear which commit(s) introduced the issue.
  wens: Likely introduced with io_uring; fixed in v5.6-rc2. Fix for v5.4 are simply
    the two mainline commits squashed in one.
