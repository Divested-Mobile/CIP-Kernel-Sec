description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.9.3. io_uring takes a
  non-refcounted reference to the files_struct of the process that submitted
  a request, causing execve() to incorrectly optimize unshare_fd(), aka
  CID-0f2122045b94.

    Based on the Project Zero description, the culprit could be
    05f3fb3c5397 ("io_uring: avoid ring quiesce for fixed file set unregister and update").
    Based on surrounding code of the fix, the culprit could be
    b5dba59e0cf7 ("io_uring: add support for IORING_OP_CLOSE")
    Both commits were added in v5.6-rc1. OTOH the fix is tagged for stable v5.5+.
    The fix is part of v5.10-rc1.
