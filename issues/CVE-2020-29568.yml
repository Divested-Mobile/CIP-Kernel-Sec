description: |-
  An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Some OSes (such as Linux,
  FreeBSD, and NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If
  the events are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will
  get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an
  OOM in the backend. All systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD (any
  version) dom0 are vulnerable.
