description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used with
  Xen through 4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel
  thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the
  handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between
  the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may
  re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0
  crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.
  Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only
  affects systems with a Linux blkback.
