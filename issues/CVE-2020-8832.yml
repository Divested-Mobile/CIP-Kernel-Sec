comments:
  bwh: The reproducer linked from Launchpad shows no leakage on 4.9.210 or 4.14.176,
    so this really does seem to be specific to the Ubuntu 4.15 branch.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Scarse details, so we need to check if this affects upstream
    and Debian or if the icnomplete fix is specific to Red Hat.
    The issue actually relates to LP1862840 an incomplete fix in
    Ubuntu kernel as apart bc8a76a152c5 ("drm/i915/gen9: Clear
    residual context state on context switch"), there is need of
    apply as well d2b4b97933f5 ("drm/i915: Record the default hw
    state after reset upon load") as prerequisite to fix
    CVE-2019-14615. For tracking purpose consider the fix in
    4.16-rc1 as the first fixed version.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: this issue is Ubuntu specific and only affects 4.15 kernels.
  wens: The information here is based on Ubuntu's bug report, which states that the
    CVE only affects Ubuntu's 4.15 kernel release. 4.4 and 5.0+ releases are not affected.
    The commits picked to fix this are from 4.16, so it is likely that 4.19 is not
    affected either. Someone should test with actual hardware whether stable kernels
    4.9 and 4.14 are affected or not.
