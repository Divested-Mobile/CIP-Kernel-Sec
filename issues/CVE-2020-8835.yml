description: In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c)
  did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to
  out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects
  the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was
  backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29.
  (issue is aka ZDI-CAN-10780)

    CRD: Monday, March 30th, 16:00 UTC.
    Introduced by commit 581738a681b6 ("bpf: Provide better
    register bounds after jmp32 instructions") in 5.5-rc1 and was
    backported to 5.4.7.
    CVE as well known as ZDI-CAN-10780.
  Ubuntu-sbeattie: |-
    introduced by upstream commit 581738a681b6, which
      was mistakenly backported to upstream stable 5.4 kernel
      (b4de258dede528f88f401259aab3147fb6da1ddf). Ubuntu's 5.3 kernels
      are affected because 5.4 stable backport commits were pulled into
      Ubuntu's 5.3 kernels.
