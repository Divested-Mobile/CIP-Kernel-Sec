comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    The bulletin links to source commits which are definitely not
    touching upstream code.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Bulletin refers to upstream kernel but unconfirmed. According
    to Moritz this is just in Android specific xt_qtaguid code and
    so actually not "upstream kernel".
  wens: Likely is Android kernel only.
ignore:
  all: Android kernel specific kernel module.
