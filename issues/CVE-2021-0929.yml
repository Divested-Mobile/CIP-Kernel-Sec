comments:
  debian/carnil: |-
    In mainline 3e9e0c5c7647 ("staging/android/ion: delete dma_buf->kmap/unmap
    implemenation") in 5.6-rc1 removed the implementation.
    e722a295cf49 ("staging: ion: remove from the tree") removed the
    driver from mainline in 5.11-rc1.
    The ION driver is not built in Debian (CONFIG_ION not enabled).
  masami: No cip member uses ION driver.
  ubuntu/alexmurray: |-
    This vulnerability is within the Ion memory allocator. This code
     is only present, BUT not enabled, in a limited number of Ubuntu
     kernels. As such no Ubuntu kernels are affected by this vulnerability.
