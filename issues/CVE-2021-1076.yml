comments:
  ubuntu/mdeslaur: |-
    some binary drivers are no longer support by NVidia, so they
    are marked as ignored here
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    issues are in nvidia drivers, but kernels need to be respun
      to handle drivers
ignore:
  all: This is related to NVIDIA's closed source binary driver
