  debian/carnil: |-
    Issue introduced seem introduced specifically in the 5.4.y with
    d18d22ce8f62 in 5.4.16. It was as such present in usntable with
    the 5.4.19-1 release and later fixed once moved to the 5.5.y
    series.
    introduced likely earlier but only uncovered later and the fix
    for older stable series is
    https://lore.kernel.org/stable/20201121034317.577081-1-xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com/
  wens: Original reported cause seems to be incorrect, though may have been interaction
    between many moving pieces. Stable kernel fix was crafted separately. Reported
    my findings back to Debian.
