    Claimed to be fixed in 5.10.2, but this cannot be the right
    version as there were no changes in 5.10.1 to 5.10.2 in
    io_uring. The Red Hat bugzilla entry has little more details.
    Possibly as well just a duplicate of CVE-2020-29534 and would
    thus be fixed earlier already for the sid branch (See SUSE
    bugzilla bug).

    Based on SUSE's bug tracker, the fix is actually 0f2122045b94 ("io_uring:
    don't rely on weak ->files references"), which is in v5.10-rc1.
    Commit introducing the issue was taken from CVE-2020-29534.
