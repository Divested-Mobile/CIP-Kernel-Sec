  debian/carnil: |-
    Claimed to be fixed in 5.10.2, but this cannot be the right
    version as there were no changes in 5.10.1 to 5.10.2 in
    io_uring. The Red Hat bugzilla entry has little more details.
    Possibly as well just a duplicate of CVE-2020-29534 and would
    thus be fixed earlier already for the sid branch (See SUSE
    bugzilla bug).
fixed-by:
  mainline: [233295130e53c8dfe6dbef3f52634c3f7e44cd6a]
