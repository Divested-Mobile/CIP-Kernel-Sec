  debian/carnil: |-
    In 5.4.y fixed in 5.4.92 with 55bac51762c3 ("net, sctp, filter:
    remap copy_from_user failure error"). For later kernel
    versions: " In case of later kernel versions this issue won't
    work anymore thanks to Christoph Hellwig's work that got rid of
    the various temporary set_fs() address space overrides
    altogether."
