description: |-
  An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation
  of the eBPF code verifier in the way a user running the eBPF script calls
  dev_map_init_map or sock_map_alloc. This flaw allows a local user to crash
  the system or possibly escalate their privileges. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system
  availability.
