description: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux: KVM through Improper handling
  of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass RO checks and can lead to pages being
  freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users with the ability
  to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in
  local privilege escalation.'
