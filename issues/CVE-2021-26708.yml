description: |-
  A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before
  5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused
  by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were
  implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport
  support.
