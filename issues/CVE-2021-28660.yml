  rtw_wx_set_scan in drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/ioctl_linux.c in the
  Linux kernel through 5.11.6 allows writing beyond the end of the ->ssid[]
  array. NOTE: from the perspective of kernel.org releases, CVE IDs are not
  normally used for drivers/staging/* (unfinished work); however, system
  integrators may have situations in which a drivers/staging issue is
  relevant to their own customer base.
