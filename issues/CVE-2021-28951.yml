description: |-
  An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through
  5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because
  exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL
  thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.
