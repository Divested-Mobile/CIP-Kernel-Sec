  access to freed memory, leading to information disclosure or root privilege
  escalation. This affects Bifrost r16p0 through r29p0 before r30p0, Valhall
  r19p0 through r29p0 before r30p0, and Midgard r28p0 through r30p0.

    I couldn't find information about this; I just saw the Linux
     kernel has some files with names that suggest they are related. This may
     or may not affect Ubuntu's Linux packages.
