description: |-
  This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on
  affected installations of Linux Kernel 5.11.15. An attacker must first
  obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in
  order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
  handling of eBPF programs. The issue results from the lack of proper
  validation of user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. An
  attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute
  arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-13661.
