description: |-
  Unencrypted Bluetooth Low Energy baseband links in Bluetooth Core
  Specifications 4.0 through 5.2 may permit an adjacent device to inject a
  crafted packet during the receive window of the listening device before the
  transmitting device initiates its packet transmission to achieve full MITM
  status without terminating the link. When applied against devices
  establishing or using encrypted links, crafted packets may be used to
  terminate an existing link, but will not compromise the confidentiality or
  integrity of the link.
