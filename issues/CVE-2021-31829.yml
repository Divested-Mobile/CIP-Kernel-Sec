description: |-
  kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.1 performs
  undesirable speculative loads, leading to disclosure of stack content via
  side-channel attacks, aka CID-801c6058d14a. The specific concern is not
  protecting the BPF stack area against speculative loads. Also, the BPF
  stack can contain uninitialized data that might represent sensitive
  information previously operated on by the kernel.
