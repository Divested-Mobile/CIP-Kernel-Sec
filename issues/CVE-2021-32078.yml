  debian/bwh: |-
    The affected platform has a StrongArm (ARM v4) CPU which was only
    supported by Debian's original arm architecture, not armel.
    Also this issue involves untrusted data from a PCI device, but
    the affected systems don't have an IOMMU so all PCI devices must
    be trusted.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Issue is in the "personal server platform", which is not
    enabled in Debian. Furthermore the fixing commit just removes
    the whole code, which is believed that no one is using it.
