description: |-
  An issue has been discovered in the Linux kernel that can be abused
  by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges. The BPF verifier
  computes limits to enforce on the pointer arithmetic operations in
  BPF programs; in a particular scenario these limits are computed
  incorrectly. When any incorrect limits are enforced, performing the
  pointer arithmetic operation may lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes
  in the kernel memory.
