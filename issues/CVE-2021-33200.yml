description: |-
  kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.7 enforces incorrect
  limits for pointer arithmetic operations, aka CID-bb01a1bba579. This can be
  abused to perform out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory, leading
  to local privilege escalation to root. In particular, there is a corner
  case where the off reg causes a masking direction change, which then
  results in an incorrect final aux->alu_limit.
