    Introduced by 7fedb63a8307 ("bpf: Tighten speculative pointer
    arithmetic mask") in 5.12-rc8 (and backported to 5.11.17,
    5.10.33, 5.4.116). Note though that 7fedb63a8307 is part of the
    fixes needed to address CVE-2021-29155 which introduces the
    buggy computation.
    Those commits were included in 4.19.193 with the fixes for
    CVE-2021-29155 and so not introducing CVE-2021-33200 in any of
    the released v4.19.y versions. Thus keeping the entry here as
    "N/A".
