description: |-
  The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32
  destination register truncation when the source register was known to
  be 0. A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use
  this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information
  disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that
  could potentially lead to code execution.

    both f6b1b3bf0d5f681631a293cfe1ca934b81716f1e and
      468f6eafa6c4 are needed for a system to be vulnerable.
    e88b2c6e5a4d9ce30d75391e4d950da74bb2bd90 is likely needed as
      a prerequisite fix as well
