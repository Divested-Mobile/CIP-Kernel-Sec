description: |-
  Ubuntu specific issue in the overlayfs file system in the Linux kernel
  where it did not properly validate the application of file system
  capabilities with respect to user namespaces. A local attacker could
  use this to gain elevated privileges, due to a patch carried in Ubuntu
  to allow unprivileged overlayfs mounts.
