  debian/carnil: |-
    Debian ships as well a patch to allow enable unprivileged
    overlayfs mounts. Cf. #913880 present since 4.19.9-1 upload.
    One needs to explicitly load the module though with
    permit_mounts_in_userns (which will issue as well a security
    warning).
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    issue is specific to Ubuntu or any other distribution that
      patched the kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, prior to
      the 5.11 commit (459c7c565ac36b) that permits it upstream.
