comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    For 4.9, commits f6b1b3bf0d5f "bpf: fix subprog verifier bypass by
    div/mod by 0 exception" and d405c7407a54 "bpf: allocate 0x06 to new
    eBPF instruction class JMP32" etc. need to be applied first.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Introduced by 68fda450a7df ("bpf: fix 32-bit divide by zero")
    in 4.15-rc9 (and was backported to 4.9.79). Though the specifc
    attack will not work on v4.9.y as pointer arithmetic is
    prohibited on those kernels.
  ubuntu/cascardo: |-
    Commit f1174f77b50c is also necessary to exploit, and is
      not present on 4.4 kernels.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    4.15 kernels the only ubuntu kernels that have not yet had
      the fix applied
    for 4.15 kernels, f6b1b3bf0d5f ("bpf: fix subprog verifier
      bypass by div/mod by 0 exception") is needed as a prerequisite but
      introduces CVE-2021-3444
