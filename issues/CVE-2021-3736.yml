    As of 2021-11-04 no further information yet provided in
    RHBZ#1995570. The description reads as "A memory leak problem
    was found in mbochs_ioctl in samples/vfio-mdev/mbochs.c in
    Virtual Function I/O (VFIO) Mediated devices. This flaw could
    allow a local attacker to leak internal kernel information."
    and so relates to changes in samples/vfio-mdev/mbochs.c .
  masami: This vulnerability is in sample code. No cip member enabled CONFIG_SAMPLE_VFIO_MDEV_MBOCHS.
