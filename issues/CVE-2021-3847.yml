comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    Only likely to be exploitable after commit 459c7c565ac3
    "ovl: unprivieged mounts" in 5.11-rc1, or if the
    Debian-specific module parameter permit_mounts_in_userns
    is enabled.
  debian/carnil: |-
    According to the followups, is considered a misconfiguration of
    the mount, and not a kernel bug. Should we retire the CVE?
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    Miklos, a primary maintainer for overlayfs, asserts in the
      SUSE bug that this is a misunderstanding of how overlayfs operates.
ignore:
  debian/stretch-security: EOL
