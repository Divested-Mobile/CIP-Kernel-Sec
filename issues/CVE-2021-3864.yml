  debian/bwh: |-
    The PoC exploits logrotate's lax parsing of configuration files
    to inject commands via the coredump, but I think generally we
    should assume that bypassing write-protection in any way can
    lead to privilege escalation.
    sudo is an important part of the PoC and should disable core-
    dumps by default.
    It's less clear what should be done in the kernel; possibly
    some resource limits should be reset on exec of a setuid
    program - see

  ubuntu/sbeattie: no fix upstream as of 2022-01-27
