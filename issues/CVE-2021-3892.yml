    At time of writing only limited information provided by Red
    Hat: "The kernel leaks memory when firewalld IPv6_rpfilter is
    enabled and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6
    routing rules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such
    scenarios, every incoming packet will leak an allocation in
    ip6_dst_cache slab cache." The SUSE bugzilla entry indicates
    this as to be related to ca7a03c41753 ("ipv6: do not free rt if
    FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule") which makes it
    potentially a duplicate of CVE-2019-18198.
