  debian/bwh: |-
    This seems to really be a bug in the Bluetooth CMTP subsystem, which has
    been present since that was added in Linux 2.6.2.
  debian/carnil: Fixed as well in 5.14.15 in 5.14.y.
  masami: isdn/capi depends on ISDN, however no cip member enables CONFIG_ISDN.
  ubuntu/cascardo: |-
    Adding a CAPI controller with CMTP requires CAP_NET_ADMIN
      in the initial namespace (init_ns). Other ISDN controllers that
      use CAPI have been removed upstream.
