    Pretty sure this is about leaking pointers. The last 2 commits
    are fixing that and the first 3 are dependencies for the fix.

    This one seems a bit compliated to track, the commits from the
    pixel/2021-12-01 are spread over two versions. But it's not
    very clear to what CVE-2021-39636 is referring to, assuming it
    is for the pointer leak to userspace?
