    This is puzzling.  The UAF occurs in net/sched/cls_api.c where
    all access to the qdisc state seems to be protected by the RTNL
    already, so it's not clear why switching to RCU protection would
    help.  The syzkaller-generated reproducer also didn't work for me.
    So I can't tell whether 4.9 might also be affected.
  debian/carnil: |-
    For 4.9.y this has a separate backport, cf.
    https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/YnE%2FQ3SwZuG9HQNv@quatroqueijos/T/#t
    which is applied.
  masami: "There is no details. These patch series modified locking strategy \nthat\
    \ use Qdisc rcu API instead of rtnl lock.\nAll patches were merged at 4.20-rc1\
    \ in the mainline."
