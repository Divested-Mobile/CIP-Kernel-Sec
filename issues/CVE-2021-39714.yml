    ion driver removing from the tree in 5.11-rc1. Earlier the
    affected code was removed with e3b914bc7eb6 ("staging: android:
    ion: Drop ion_map_kernel interface") in 4.12-rc1.

    There is no details. This patch removes some functions in
    drivers/staging/android/ion/ion.c.
    The ion driver was removed from mainline in 5.11-rc1.
    This fix was merged in 4.12-rc1. 
    The patch removes ion_handle_kmap_get(), ion_map_kernel(),
    and ion_unmap_kernel().
    For 4.4, ion_handle_kmap_get() is called from ion_map_kernel()
    but it looks ion_map_kernel() isn't called from anywhere.
    So, It seems to be okay to remove these functions from 4.4.y.
