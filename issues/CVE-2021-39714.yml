    ion driver removing from the tree in 5.11-rc1. Earlier the
    affected code was removed with e3b914bc7eb6 ("staging: android:
    ion: Drop ion_map_kernel interface") in 4.12-rc1.
  masami: "There is no details. This patch removes some functions in\ndrivers/staging/android/ion/ion.c.\n\
    The ion driver was removed from mainline in 5.11-rc1.\nThis fix was merged in\
    \ 4.12-rc1. \nThe patch removes ion_handle_kmap_get(), ion_map_kernel(),\nand\
    \ ion_unmap_kernel().\nFor 4.4, ion_handle_kmap_get() is called from\nion_map_kernel()\
    \ but it looks ion_map_kernel() isn't\ncalled from anywhere. So, It seems to be\
    \ okay to remove\nthese functions from 4.4.y."
