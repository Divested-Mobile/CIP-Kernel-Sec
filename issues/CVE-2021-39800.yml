    ION was remove by commit e722a29 ("staging: ion: remove from the tree")
    which was merged in 5.11-rc1. There is a big different between 4.9 and
    4.19/5.10 so 4.19 and 5.10 may not have this issue. 4.4 may affected by
    this isseu. However, no CIP member enables CONFIG_ION in 4.4 kernel.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    CONFIG_ION is disabled in Ubuntu kernels (with the exception
      of linux-xilinx-zynqmp/focal), so are not affected by this.
    the ION memory manager was removed from the kernel in
      e722a295cf49 ("staging: ion: remove from the tree") (v5.11-rc1)
