    Unclear if this is Android specific. If so we might just drop
    this entry.
    this is probably not an issue in mainline, the propblematic
    patch introducing the vulnerability was not merged in Linus
    tree, cf. https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAHk-=wj4KCujAH_oPh40Bkp48amM4MXr+8AcbZ=qd5LF4Q+TDg@mail.gmail.com/#t
  masami: "Commit ac44888 reverts b44e46b and commit 67d075d reverts \n6f9aba5. These\
    \ commits aren't in the mainline.\nIt seems as if this vulnerability android kernel\
    \ specific."
