    Introduced in 5.15-rc1 by commit 9d3b8813895d "block: change the
    refcounting for partitions", so never appeared in a stable release.
  masami: "out_put_disk label was added by commit 9d3b881 (\"block: change the refcounting\
    \ for \npartitions\") since 5.15-rc1. So it looks before 5.15 kernel doesn't affect\
    \ this issue."
