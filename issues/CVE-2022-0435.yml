  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    introduced in v4.8
    mitigated by CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, enabled in Ubuntu
      kernels since v4.18 kernels (Ubuntu 18.10 and newer, as well as
      HWE kernels for 18.04 LTS), mitigates this into a DoS.
    for 4.15 kernels as used in 18.04 LTS and HWE for 16.04 ESM,
      kernels are built with stack-protector, which makes this more
      difficult to exploit.
