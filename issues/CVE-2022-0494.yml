    A kernel information leak bug was found in bio_copy_kern(). An local attacker
    send SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND cmd via scsi_ioctl(), there is a path to return
    uninialized buffer to user which cause kernel information leak.
    Its looks like earlier than 5.13 kernels may be affected by this issue.
