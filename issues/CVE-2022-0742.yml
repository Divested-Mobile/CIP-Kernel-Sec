    As of 2022-03-14 the Red Hat bugzilla entry contains a "TODO
    add link to patch when public" marking but not yet references
    to upstream fixes, but claims to be introduced in commit
    f185de28d9ae ("mld: add new workqueues for process mld
    events"). The fix seems to be 2d3916f31891 ("ipv6: fix skb
    drops in igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()"), which
    is applied in 5.17-rc7.
    For 5.16.y the issue is fixed in 5.16.13.
