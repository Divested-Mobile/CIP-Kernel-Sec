  debian/bwh: |-
    The second part (commit aa6f8dcbab47) was reverted and replaced by
    commit 901c7280ca0d "Reinstate some of "swiotlb: rework "fix info
    leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE""" in 5.18-rc1. That was applied in 5.17.2
    but should probably be applied to other stable branches too.
  debian/carnil: |-
    For 5.16.y fixed as well in 5.16.15.
    The initial fix commited to mainline which landed in 5.17-rc6
    was an old version and so made necessary to followup with a
    rework commit aa6f8dcbab47 ("swiotlb: rework "fix info leak
    with DMA_FROM_DEVICE"").
    The second part of the fix was holded back for stable trees due to
    regression caused on at least some wireless drivers, cf.

  masami: "Commit aa6f8dc fixes ddbd89d. commit ddbd89d was marged in 5.17-rc6.\n\
    Commit ddbd89d describes commit a45b599 (\"scsi: sg: allocate with __GFP_ZERO\
    \ in\nsg_build_indirect()\") in the bug flaw steps. The commit a45b599 was backported\n\
    to stable kernels(includes 4.4.y). So it seems as if stable kernels are\naffected\
    \ by this issue.  \nPatches were failed to apply to 4.9, 4.19, 5.4, and 5.10.\n\
    Also, kernel/dma/swiotlb.c and related files were moved from lib/ to kernel/dma/\n\
    since 4.18-rc2 by commit cf65a0f (\"dma-mapping: move all DMA mapping code to\
    \ \nkernel/dma\")."
