description: |-
  An out of bounds access was discovered in nf_tables expression evaluation
  due to validation of user register indices. It leads to local privilege
  escalation, for example by overwriting a stack return address OOB with
  a crafted nft_expr_payload.

    If I understand this correctly, the issue is that nft_parse_register()
    could return a very large register number that would lead to integer
    overflow in the range check in nft_validate_register_{load,store}().
    This was not exploitable before commit 345023b0db3 because all in-tree
    callers truncated the return value of nft_parse_register() to 8 bits
    before passing it on to nft_validate_register_{load,store}().
    I also didn't find any out-of-tree modules using nft_parse_register()
    through codesearch.debian.net or GitHub.

    Exploitable starting from commit 345023b0db3 ("netfilter:
    nftables: add nft_parse_register_store() and use it") in
    5.12-rc1 but bug present since commit 49499c3e6e18 ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: switch registers to 32 bit addressing") in 4.1-rc1
    Fixed in 5.17.1 for 5.17.y and 5.16.18 for 5.16.y.

    This root cuase was introduced by commit 49499c3
    ("netfilter: nf_tables: switch registers to 32 bit addressing")
    which merged in 4.1-rc. However, it exploitable by commit 345023b
    ("netfilter: nftables: add nft_parse_register_store() and use it")
    which merged in 5.12-rc1-dontuse.
    Therefore, earlier than 5.12 kernels have OOB bug but they wouldn't
    exploit via this bug.

    requires CAP_NET_ADMIN, however this can be done within a new
     user namespace and network namespace - so can be mitigated by disabling
     unprivileged user namespaces.
