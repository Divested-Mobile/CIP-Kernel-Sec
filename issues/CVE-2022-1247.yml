comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    I'm assuming all branches are affected because I don't see any
    locking changes since 4.9.
    In bullseye and newer releases this is mitigated because we
    disabled auto-loading of the rose module.
  masami: |-
    A race condition bug was found in rose driver(Amateur Radio X.25 PLP
    (Rose)). No CIP member enables CONFIG_ROSE.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    mitigation is to disable and prevent af_rose from being
      autoloaded, I suspect.
    unfixed upstream as of 2023.01.10
