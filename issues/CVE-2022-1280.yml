    I think most of these are fixing similar races even if some are not
    needed for the specific race in the description.  I don't think it
    makes any sense to backport them selectively.

    Not a problem on 5.15.y and newer, but the list of commits need
    to be isolated yet.
    Is the main fix 56f0729a510f ("drm: protect drm_master pointers
    in drm_lease.c")? Situation though is not very clear and what
    exactly is needed.

    The reporter found this bug in 4.19.237. Kernel 5.15 and newer are already
    fixed (https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/4) but not described
    which commit(s) fixes this bug. According to the PoC
    (https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/3),
    it needs to open /dev/dri/card0. However, /dev/dri/card0's permission is following.
    crw-rw----+ 1 root video 226, 0 Apr 13 09:15 /dev/dri/card0 So, attacker must
    have correct privilege to abuse this CVE.
    The commit 1f7ef07 was reverted in 5.10
    (https://lore.kernel.org/stable/20210628142607.32218-97-sashal@kernel.org/).
    Searching in lore.kernel.org, the commit 869e76f looks as if it isn't
    backported to stable kernels.
    Searching in lore.kernel.org, the commit 28be240 looks as if it isn't
    backported to stable kernels.
