    As of 2022-05-26 not much details provided in RH bugzilla:
    descriptions reads as An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in
    the Linux kernelâ€™s TeleTYpe subsystem. The issue occurs in
    how a user triggers a race condition using ioctls TIOCSPTLCK
    and TIOCGPTPEER and TIOCSTI and TCXONC with leakage of memory
    in the flush_to_ldisc function. This flaw allows a local user
    to crash the system or read unauthorized random data from
    memory.
    Issue introduced by 71a174b39f10 ("pty: do tty_flip_buffer_push
    without port->lock in pty_write") in 5.10-rc1.
  ubuntu/seth-arnold: I didn't spot a fix anywhere
