    Introduced with 73a6bab5aa2a ("tcp: switch pacing timer to
    softirq based hrtimer") in 4.18-rc1. The issue only affects 4.18-
    4.19 as 4.20-rc1 when TCP stack adopted EDT model, the issue
    was fixed along.

    import_stable script set 0a70f118475e037732557796accd0878a00fc25a
    as fixed commit in the mainline. However, it is not mentioned
    which commit(s) fixed this issue in the mainline.
    so, temporary sets v4.20's commit hash to fixed revision instead
    of 0a70f11 because commit 0a70f11 isn't in the mainline.
