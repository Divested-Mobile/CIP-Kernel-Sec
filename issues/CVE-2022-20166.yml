    Based on the Android backport of this, the specific case where a
    buffer overflow was possible must be in the name attribute of a
    wakeup_source.  This code was introduced in 5.4 by commit
    c8377adfa781 "PM / wakeup: Show wakeup sources stats in sysfs".
    If wakelocks are enabled (CONFIG_PM_WAKELOCKS=y) then user-space
    can create a wakeup_source with an arbitrary name.  However, we
    never enabled this.

    The commit aa83889 ("drivers core: Use sysfs_emit and
    sysfs_emit_at for show(device *...) ……functions") was
    merged in 5.10-rc1.
    Thic commit isn't backported to 4.x kernels. So, if
    backporting commit CVE-2022-20166 to 4.x series,
    commit aa83889 is required.
