  debian/bwh: I think we can ignore this since we don't enable kgdb.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Lockdown firstly introduced upstream in 5.4-rc1. On the other
    hand though, Debian ships since 4.11-1~exp1 the lockdown
    patches (replaced from the securelevel patch). Issue possibly
    as well present already in the securelevel patchset.
    Fixed as well in 5.17.10 for 5.17.y.
  masami: |-
    Using gdb or kgdb, it will be able to read/write kernel
    memory even though lockdown feature is enabled.
    The lockdown feature was intorduced in 5.4. Earlier than 5.4
    kernels aren't affected by this issue.
