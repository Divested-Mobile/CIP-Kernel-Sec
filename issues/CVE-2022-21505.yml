  debian/carnil: |-
    Released as well in 5.18.15 for 5.18.y.
    Commit fixes 29d3c1c8dfe7 ("kexec: Allow kexec_file() with
    appropriate IMA policy when locked down") in 5.4-rc1.
    CONFIG_IMA was only re-enabled in Debian in 5.13.9-1~exp1
    and the issue does not affect bullseye's built binary packages.
