description: |-
  blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing
  whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case,
  they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always
  succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted
  page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep
  access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be
  used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a
  similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the
  granted access of a shared ring buffer.

    CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039,
    and CVE-2022-23040 are kind of group.
    These CVEs are Xen's vulnerability. These vulnerability will cause
    race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption,
    DoS by malicious backends(blkfront, netfront, scsifront, gntalloc,
    xenbus).
