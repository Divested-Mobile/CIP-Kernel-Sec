description: |-
  blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing
  whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case,
  they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always
  succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted
  page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep
  access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be
  used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a
  similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the
  granted access of a shared ring buffer.
