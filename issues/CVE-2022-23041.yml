description: |-
  blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront,
  and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference
  until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page
  is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the
  backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed
  and then re-used for a different purpose.
