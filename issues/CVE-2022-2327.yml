  ubuntu/rodrigo-zaiden: duplicate or much related to CVE-2022-2209
  masami: |-
    Commit df3f3bb ("io_uring: add missing item types for various requests") has
    kernel panic bug, commit fb2fbb3 ("io_uring: use separate list entry for iopoll requests")
    fixes this bug.
    The flag IO_WQ_WORK_FILES was merged in 5.10-rc1 commit 0f20376 ("io_uring: pass required
    context in as flags") and has been removed since 5.12-rc1dontuse commit 44526be
    ("io_uring: remove any grabbing of context") so 5.10  kernel was only affected by this
    vulnerability.
