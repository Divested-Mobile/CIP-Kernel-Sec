description: |-
  BluetoothÂ® Low Energy Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification v4.0 through
  v5.3 may permit an unauthenticated MITM to acquire credentials with two
  pairing devices via adjacent access when the MITM negotiates Legacy Passkey
  Pairing with the pairing Initiator and Secure Connections Passkey Pairing
  with the pairing Responder and brute forces the Passkey entered by the user
  into the Initiator. The MITM attacker can use the identified Passkey value
  to complete authentication with the Responder via Bluetooth pairing method
  confusion.
