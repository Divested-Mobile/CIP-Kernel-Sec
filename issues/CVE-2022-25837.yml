description: |-
  BluetoothÂ® Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification v1.0B through v5.3 may
  permit an unauthenticated MITM to acquire credentials with two pairing
  devices via adjacent access when at least one device supports BR/EDR Secure
  Connections pairing and the other BR/EDR Legacy PIN code pairing if the
  MITM negotiates BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing in Secure Connections mode
  using the Passkey association model with the pairing Initiator and BR/EDR
  Legacy PIN code pairing with the pairing Responder and brute forces the
  Passkey entered by the user into the Responder as a 6-digit PIN code. The
  MITM attacker can use the identified PIN code value as the Passkey value to
  complete authentication with the Initiator via Bluetooth pairing method
  confusion.
