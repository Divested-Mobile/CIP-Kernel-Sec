    Commit fixes 9ae0f87d009c ("mm/shmem: unconditionally set pte
    dirty in mfill_atomic_install_pte") in 5.16-rc1.
    David Hildenbrand reports that "Kernels before extended uffd-wp
    support and before PageAnonExclusive (< 5.19) can simply revert
    the problematic commit instead and be safe regarding
    UFFDIO_CONTINUE. A backport to v5.19 requires minor adjustments
    due to lack of vma_soft_dirty_enabled()."
    Fix is backported as well to 5.19.6 for 5.19.y
