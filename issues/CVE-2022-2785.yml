description: |-
  There exists an arbitrary memory read within the Linux Kernel BPF -
  Constants provided to fill pointers in structs passed in to bpf_sys_bpf are
  not verified and can point anywhere, including memory not owned by BPF. An
  attacker with CAP_BPF can arbitrarily read memory from anywhere on the
  system. We recommend upgrading past commit 86f44fcec22c
