    According to the Intel security advisroy INTEL-SA-00687, it saild that
     "IntelÂ® PROSet/Wireless WiFi drivers to mitigate this vulnerability
     will be up streamed by November 08, 2022." so mainline kernel seems
     affected by this issue.

    It is not clear from the upstream advisory which software
     component is affected and hence what patches if any may be available to
     fix it, but since the advisory states that Linux is affected I am
     presuming this may be the iwlwifi driver within the kernel and hence am
     assigning it to the kernel packages in Ubuntu
