  Unprotected alternative channel of return branch target prediction in
  some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially
  enable information disclosure via local access. Alternative form of
  return branch target prediction in some Intel(R) Processors may allow
  an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via
  local access.
  .
  RSBA behavior allows alternate branch predictors to be used by
  near RET instructions when the RSB is empty. When eIBRS is enabled,
  the predicted target of these alternate predictors are restricted
  to those belonging to the indirect branch predictor entries of the
  current prediction domain.
