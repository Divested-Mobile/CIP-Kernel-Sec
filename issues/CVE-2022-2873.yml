    Tracking for this CVE is quite confusing, as Red Hat Bugzilla
    entries RHBZ#2119048 and RHBZ#2123309 differ in views. For now
    we have to track the two CVEs according to what we have in
    those two bugzilla entries are the CVEs are assigned by Red Hat
    CNA. Trying to monitor both.
    Fixed as well in 6.1.2 for 6.1.y and 6.0.16 for 6.0.y.

    Commit 5e9a97b ("i2c: ismt: Adding support for
    I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_PROC_CALL") was merged in 5.11-rc1.
    So, earlier than this versions are not affected.
