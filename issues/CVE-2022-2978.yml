    A freeing uninitialized memory bug was found in
    nilfs_mdt_destroy(). This bug occurs in an error path.
    If allocating memory for inode is failed in inode_init_always(),
    it returns ENOMEM. Then nilfs_mdt_destroy() is called which
    frees uninialized data.
    It looks 4.4 kernel is affected by this bug too.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: unfixed upstream as of 2022/09/24
