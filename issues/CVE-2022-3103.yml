    The CVE entry is quite unclear, and just references the 6.0-rc3
    tag. I suspect 47abea041f89 ("io_uring: fix off-by-one in sync
    cancelation file check") is the targetted off-by-one issue.
    Then this though only fixes 78a861b94959 ("io_uring: add sync
    cancelation API through io_uring_register()") in 6.0-rc1.
  masami: It only affected from 6.0-rc1 to 6.0-rc2.
