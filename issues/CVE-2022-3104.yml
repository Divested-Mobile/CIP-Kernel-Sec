    Introduced in 5.7 by commit ae2e1aad3e48e495878d9f149e437a308bfdaefa
    "drivers/misc/lkdtm/bugs.c: add arithmetic overflow and array bounds
    checks".
    This doesn't seem to be a security issue because the *purpose* of
    this driver is to trigger crashes (just not in this specific place).
