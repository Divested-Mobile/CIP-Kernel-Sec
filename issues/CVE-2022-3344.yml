comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    The first two fixes seem to be needed only after commit 2fcf4876ada8
    "KVM: nSVM: implement on demand allocation of the nested state" in
    5.10. The last two are probably needed for 4.19 as well, though
    backporting them doesn't look straightforward.
  debian/carnil: Fixed as well in 6.0.11 for 6.0.y.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: it's possible only the first two commits are necessary
