  debian/carnil: |-
    Commit fixes a4e430c8c8ba ("cifs: replace kfree() with
    kfree_sensitive() for sensitive data") which is as well only in
    6.1-rc1. No released version were ever affected.
  ubuntu/rodrigo-zaiden: |-
    the vulnerable commit itself (without the fix commit), is
     not present in any released version, hence all versions are not-affected.
    in linux-azure kernel for Jammy (5.15), both vulnerable
     and fix commits are included as a patchset to update CIFS to 6.5 in
     version 5.15.0-1051.59, so, this kernel is still not-affected as the
     vulnerable code can not be found without the fix commit in any release.
