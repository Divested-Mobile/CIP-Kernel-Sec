    The reported vulnerability is on mlxsw driver, and the
      Fixes: commit is the one introducing that vulnerability, which
      would be 98bbf70c1c41fb9547c3a18c0f1b96f6ebb8eb1d. However, we
      are opting to use 45f05def5c44c806f094709f1c9b03dcecdd54f0 as
      the introducing commit in case other drivers or the same driver
      decide to rely on that mitigation and introduce new features with
      the same kind of vulnerability.
