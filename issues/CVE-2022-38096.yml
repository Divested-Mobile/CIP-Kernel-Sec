    I think this is present since vmw_cmd_dx_define_query() was
    added to the driver, but without more details it's hard to know.

    drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_execbuf.c not found in the mainline.
    It may be drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_execbuf.c instead.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: unfixed upstream as of 2023/01/10
