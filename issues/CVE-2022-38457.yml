description: |-
  A use-after-free(UAF) vulnerability was found in function
  'vmw_cmd_res_check' in drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_execbuf.c in Linux
  kernel's vmwgfx driver with device file '/dev/dri/renderD128 (or Dxxx)'.
  This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain
  privilege, causing a denial of service(DoS).

  debian/bwh: |-
    Probably introduced in 4.20 by commit e8c66efbfe3a "drm/vmwgfx: Make
    user resource lookups reference-free during validation".
  masami: |-
    drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_execbuf.c not found in the mainline.
    It may be drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_execbuf.c instead.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    unfixed upstream as of 2022/11/28
    ffb6260be81f ("drm/vmwgfx: clean up some error pointer
      checking") does not address this issue, but looks to be covering
      something similar.
