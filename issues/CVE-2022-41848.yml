comments:
  debian/carnil: |-
    Negligible security impact, would need physical access to
    "exploit"
  masami: |-
    This Vulnerability is affected if CONFIG_SYNCLINK_CS(SyncLink PC
    Card support) is enabled.
    PCMCIA driver has removed by cec24b8b6bb841a1 in 6.4.
    No CIP member enables CONFIG_CARDMAN_4000(2023-08-22).
  ubuntu/cascardo: requires physically proximate access to systems with PCMCIA
  ubuntu/sbeattie: unfixed upstream as of 2023.01.10
