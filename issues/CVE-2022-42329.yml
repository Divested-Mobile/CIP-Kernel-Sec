    Introduced by commit be81992 ("xen/netback: don't queue unlimited number of packages")
     in v5.16-rc7. This commit fixes f48da8b ("xen-netback: fix unlimited guest Rx
     internal queue and carrier flapping") in 3.18-rc3.
    Commit be81992 is not backported to 4.4 kernel because drivers/net/xen-netback/rx.c isn't present in 4.4.
    However, 4.9, 4.19, 5.4, 5.10, 5.15 are affected.
    CVE-2022-42328 and CVE-2022-42329 have same root cause also fixed by same commit.
