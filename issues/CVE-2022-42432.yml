description: |-
  This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information
  on affected installations of the Linux Kernel 6.0-rc2. An attacker must
  first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target
  system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists
  within the nft_osf_eval function. The issue results from the lack of proper
  initialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage
  this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in
  the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-18540.
