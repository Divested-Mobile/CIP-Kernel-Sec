  debian/carnil: |-
    Negligible security impact, would need physical access to
    "exploit"
  masami: It looks all stable kernels (include 4.4) affected by this issue.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    unfixed upstream as of 2023.09.01
    exploiting this vulnerability requires disconnecting a DVB
      device, which is why this has been prioritized as low.
    SUSE bug report claims 4172385b0c9a ("media: dvb-core: Fix
      use-after-free due on race condition at dvb_net") is applied for
      this and reverted, but actually 6769a0b7ee0c ("media: dvb-core:
      Fix use-after-free on race condition at dvb_frontend") is meant
      and was reverted in ec21a38df77a.
