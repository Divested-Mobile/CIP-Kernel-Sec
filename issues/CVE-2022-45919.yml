comments:
  debian/carnil: |-
    Negligible security impact, would need physical access to
    "exploit"
  masami: It looks all stable kernels (include 4.4) affected by this issue.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    unfixed upstream as of 2023.01.10
    exploiting this vulnerability requires disconnecting a DVB
      device, which is why this has been prioritized as low.
