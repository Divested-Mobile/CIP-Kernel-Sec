  debian/bwh: |-
    In 4.19 the vulnerable function is in
    drivers/staging/wilc1000/wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c.
  masami: |-
    It looks vulnerable function is not present on 4.4 and 4.9.
    That function is present in 5.4 and 4.19 however, this driver is staging driver
    in that time. Also, implementation of wilc_wfi_cfg_parse_ch_attr()
    in 5.4 and 4.19 are differentt from newer code. It seems as if they are not affected.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: this driver was in the staging tree until the v5.9 kernel.
