  debian/bwh: |-
    The RSN parsing code was significantly refactored after 4.19 by
    commit 4e0b0f42c9c7 "staging: wilc1000: use struct to pack join
    parameters for FW, but I suspect it already had this bug.
    The vulnerable function would be in
    drivers/staging/wilc1000/host_interface.c
  masami: "It looks vulnerable function is not present in 4.x kernels. \nThat function\
    \ is present in 5.4 however, this driver is staging driver in that time."
  ubuntu/sbeattie: this driver was in the staging tree until the v5.9 kernel
