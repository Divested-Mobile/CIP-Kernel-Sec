    In 4.19 the vulnerable function is in
    drivers/staging/wilc1000/wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c.
  masami: "It looks vulnerable function is not present on 4.4 and 4.9. \nThat function\
    \ is present in 4.19 however, this driver is staging driver\nin that time. Also,\
    \ implementation of wilc_wfi_cfg_parse_ch_attr()\nin 5.4 and 4.19 are differentt\
    \ from newer code.\nIt seems as if they are not affected."
  ubuntu/sbeattie: this driver was in the staging tree until the v5.9 kernel
