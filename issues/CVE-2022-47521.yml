    It looks vulnerable function is not present on 4.4 and 4.9. 
    That function is present in 4.19 however, this driver is staging driver
    in that time. Also, implementation of wilc_wfi_cfg_parse_ch_attr()
    in 5.4 and 4.19 are differentt from newer code.
    It seems as if they are not affected.
