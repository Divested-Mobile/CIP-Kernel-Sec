description: |-
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a
  denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Linux
  Kernel. Authentication is required to exploit this
  vulnerability.
  .
  The specific flaw exists within the handling of
  SMB2_TREE_CONNECT commands. The issue results from the lack of
  proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a
  read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
  leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service
  condition on the system.
