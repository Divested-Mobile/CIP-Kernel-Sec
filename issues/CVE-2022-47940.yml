description: |-
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
  information on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication
  is required to exploit this vulnerability.
  .
  The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_WRITE commands.
  The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
  data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
  An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.
