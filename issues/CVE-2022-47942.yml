description: |-
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
  affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is required to
  exploit this vulnerability.
  .
  The specific flaw exists within the handling of file attributes. The
  issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of
  user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An
  attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context
  of the kernel.
