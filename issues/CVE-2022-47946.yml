description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.10.x before 5.10.155. A
  use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to
  crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service. finish_wait can be
  skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and
  then quickly terminating it. NOTE: later kernel versions, such as the 5.15
  longterm series, substantially changed the implementation of
  io_sqpoll_wait_sq.
