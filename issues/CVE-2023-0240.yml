description: |-
  There is a logic error in io_uring's implementation which can be used to
  trigger a use-after-free vulnerability leading to privilege escalation. In
  the io_prep_async_work function the assumption that the last
  io_grab_identity call cannot return false is not true, and in this case the
  function will use the init_cred or the previous linked requests identity to
  do operations instead of using the current identity. This can lead to
  reference counting issues causing use-after-free. We recommend upgrading
  past version 5.10.161.

  debian/carnil: |-
    Introduced with 1e6fa5216a0e ("io_uring: COW io_identity on
    mismatch") in 5.10-rc1. For mainline and other branches
    consider the commit removing io_identity as the final one
    fixing the issue.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    no fixes information given, so using 2b188cc1bb85 ("Add
      io_uring IO interface") as an upper bounds on affected versions; this
      is almost surely incorrect.
