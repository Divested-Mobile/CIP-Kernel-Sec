    Commit fixes 1fa4445f9adf ("ALSA: control - introduce
    snd_ctl_notify_one() helper") in 5.13-rc1.
    Fixed as well in 6.1.6 for 6.1.y.
  ubuntu/rodrigo-zaiden: |-
    USN-5975-1 first publication included esm/xenial linux-gcp
      version 4.15.0-1146.162~16.04.1 by mistake, it got fixed in version
      4.15.0-1147.163~16.04.1 as published in USN-6009-1.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    the fix commit claims that the issues is only present in 5.13
      and newer, but it's not clear why, from both the history of the
      snd_ctl_elem_read() path and the compat path.
