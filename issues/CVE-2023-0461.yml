  debian/carnil: |-
    To reach the vulnerability it is said that the kernel needs to
    be configured with CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP. While
    code present the issue should not be exploitable for privilege
    escalation in bullseye and earlier.
  masami: |-
    Introduced by commit 734942c ("tcp: ULP infrastructure") in 4.13-rc1,
    so 4.4.y kernels are not affected by this issue.
  ubuntu/rodrigo-zaiden: |-
    for some kernels, an extra commit was applied as a follow
     up commit: "UBUNTU: SAUCE: Fix inet_csk_listen_start after CVE-2023-0461"
     to properly address an error code variable during the backport.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: reported by google kCTF, apparently.
