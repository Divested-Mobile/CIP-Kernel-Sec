  debian/bwh: |-
    The io_uring update in 5.10.162 is based on 5.15.85, so this issue
    was never present in 5.10.y.
  debian/carnil: |-
    As 5.10.y got a rebase to the io_uring code base for 5.15.y
    5.10.y needs to be checked explicitly. The issue was fixed as
    well in 5.15.82.
  masami: |-
    Introduced by commit aa43477 ("io_uring: poll rework") in 5.17-rc1.
    This commit was backported to 5.15 so 5.15 is affected. It isn't
    backported to 5.4 and 5.10.
