- bwh> The issues mentioned are (1) memory leak (2) divide by zero
- bwh> (3) integer overflow and were already fixed by 2023-02-01.
- 'bwh> So I think (1) was fixed by 1f65ea411cc7 "media: vivid:'
- bwh> dev->bitmap_cap wasn't freed in all cases" and (3) was fixed
- 'bwh> by f8bcaf714abf "media: vivid: s_fbuf: add more sanity checks".'
- bwh> By process of elimination, I think (2) must have been fixed by
- 'bwh> 69d78a80da4e "media: vivid: set num_in/outputs to 0 if not'
- bwh> supported" although I didn't see a specific code flow that
- bwh> would lead to division by zero.

comments:
  debian/carnil: |-
    According to the Red Hat Bugzilla #c7 reference, they should be
    fixed all in the latest upstream vivid code. Debian builds
    VIDEO_VIVID as module.
  masami: |-
    Introduced by commit ef834f7 ("[media] vivid: add the video capture and output parts")
    in 3.18-rc1. Config files in cip-kernel-config are not enable vivid's test driver.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: should consider disabling the CONFIG_VIDEO_VIVID option.
