  debian/carnil: |-
    Technically not a linux issue but track with the CVE entry as well
    the kernel side mitigations for the issue in case no amd64-microcode
    update is available and we need the fallback to the chicken bit set.
  ubuntu/alexmurray: |-
    In Ubuntu the linux-firmware source package does not ship the
     AMD microcode - instead this is contained within the amd64-microcode
     source package. There is also an associated patch for the Linux kernel to
     add a new chicken-bit which will automatically be set to enable a fallback
     workaround in the kernel in the case that the associated microcode is not
     available. Finally, the updates released by AMD on 2023-07-24 only cover
     Rome / Castle Peak and Mendocino designs - updates for consumer oriented
     designs like Matisse, Renoir etc are expected later in the year.
     This is not planned to be fixed for the amd64-microcode package in Ubuntu
     14.04 as that release was already outside of the LTS timeframe when this
     hardware platform was launched.
