    As noted in the commit: Note this patch is specific to stable
    branches 5.4 and 5.10. Since in newer kernel releases binder no
    longer caches a pointer to the vma. Instead, it has been
    refactored to use vma_lookup() which avoids the issue described
    here. This switch was introduced in commit a43cfc87caaf
    ("android: binder: stop saving a pointer to the VMA").

    patch for backport kernels is "binder: fix UAF of alloc->vma
      in race with munmap()" (27a594bc7a7c in linux-5.4.y)
