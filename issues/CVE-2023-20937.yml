comments:
  masami: This bug is in Android Common Kernel so that it doesn't affect to mainline/stable/cip
    kernels.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    this is likely Android specific, as it's an issue with the
      interaction of CONFIG_SPECULATIVE_PAGE_FAULT, which never made it
      upstream (see lore link for thread).
introduced-by:
  mainline: never
fixed-by:
  mainline: never
ignore:
  all: This is Android kernel specific bug.
