    This bug fixes drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_accessory.c
    which is not in the mainline kernel.
    So, this bug is android kernel specific so that mainline
    and stable kernels aren't affected.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    USB gadget accessories are part of an Android specific patch
      set not included in the upstream. Introduced in the Android kernel in
      483cb5629ea7 ("ANDROID: usb: gadget: f_accessory: Add Android
      Accessory function")
ignore:
  all: Android kernel specific bug
