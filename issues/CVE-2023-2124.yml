    The xlog_recover_buf_commit_pass2() has been introduced by commit
    1094d3f1 ("refactor log recovery buffer item dispatch for pass2 commit
    functions") in 5.8-rc1. Before the commit 1094d3f1, this function was
    called xlog_recover_buffer_pass2().
    In 4.4, 4.14, and 4.19,  the xlog_recover_buffer_pass2() is in the
    fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c.
