    From ZDI advisory: "Mitigation: Given the nature of the
    vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to
    restrict interaction with the application." Upstream related
    commit is 4e006c7a6dac ("net: rpl: fix rpl header size
    calculation").
    Exploitng the issue requires rpl_seg_enabled to be enabled
    (net.ipv6.conf.*.rpl_seg_enabled=1)
    Fixed as well in 6.3.8 for 6.3.y.

    It was introduced by commit 8610c7c ("net: ipv6: add support
    for rpl sr exthdr") in 5.7-rc1 and fixed in 6.3. Before 5.7
    kernels don't contain commit 8610c7c so that these kernels
    aren't affected.
