    This doesn't seem to have a security impact as this function is
    only called during probe of a platform device.  Introduced in
    4.14 by commit 1df79cb3bae7 "phy: tegra: Handle return value of
    kasprintf", which itself fixed a (theoretical) null pointer
    dereference.

    Introduced by commit 0460467 ("phy: tegra: fix device-tree node lookups")
