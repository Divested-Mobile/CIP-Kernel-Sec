  Bluetooth BR/EDR devices with Secure Simple Pairing and Secure Connections
  pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2 through 5.4 allow certain

  discovery of the encryption key and live injection, aka BLUFFS.

    This CVE's CPE is assigned to bluetooth(vendor) and
    bluetooth_core_specification(product) so it needs to be fixed in
    protocol level.
    Debian project doesn't assigned this CVE to linux package because
    of bluetooth's protocol level bug.
