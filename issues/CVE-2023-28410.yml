    While it is said to be fixed with 6.2.10 upstream, there are no
    i915 changes between 6.2.9 and 6.2.10 which seem to match
    either the issue or the reporter.
    Claimed that the actual fix is 661412e301e2 ("drm/i915/gem: add
    missing boundary check in vm_access") which would imply that
    the fix is already present in 5.19-rc1 and backported to
    5.17.2, 5.16.19, 5.15.33 and 5.10.110. This does not match the
    6.2.10 information.

    It looks 5390a02 ("drm/i915/dpt: Treat the DPT BO as a framebuffer")
    and 1c9faad ("drm/i915/gem: Flush lmem contents after construction")
    fix memory related bug. But not sure, which commit/both fix this CVE,
    nor neither.
    Commit 661412e ("drm/i915/gem: add missing boundary check in vm_access")
    in 5.19-rc1 is fixing this CVE. This bug was introduced by commit
    9f909e2 ("drm/i915: Implement vm_ops->access for gdb access into mmaps")
    in 5.8-rc1.
