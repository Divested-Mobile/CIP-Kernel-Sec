    While it is said to be fixed with 6.2.10 upstream, there are no
    i915 changes between 6.2.9 and 6.2.10 which seem to match
    either the issue or the reporter.

    It looks 5390a02 ("drm/i915/dpt: Treat the DPT BO as a framebuffer")
    and 1c9faad ("drm/i915/gem: Flush lmem contents after construction")
    fix memory related bug. But not sure, which commit/both fix this CVE,
    nor neither.
