comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    The fix is marked as fixing commit effda4dd97e8 "ipv6: Pass
    fib6_result to fib lookups" which also went into 5.2, but
    the bug seems to predate that.
  debian/carnil: |-
    Report actually not very clear in RHBZ#2211440 as the
    additional references are closed.
