description: |-
  A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in netlink_dump. This
  issue can occur when the Netlink socket receives the message(sendmsg) for
  the XFRM_MSG_GETSA, XFRM_MSG_GETPOLICY type message, and the DUMP flag is
  set and can cause a denial of service or possibly another unspecified
  impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully
  ruled out, although it is unlikely.
