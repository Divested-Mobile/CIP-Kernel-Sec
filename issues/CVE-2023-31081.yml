  debian/bwh: |-
    vidtv driver (CONFIG_DVB_VIDTV) is not enabled in official
    configs.  Introduced at the earliest in 5.10 by commit
    f90cf6079bf6 "media: vidtv: add a bridge driver".
  masami: |-
    Bug is in a test driver. No CIP member enables DVB_TEST_DRIVERS
    in the cip-kernel-config.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    v4l test drivers, specifically the DVB test drivers. These
      are only built when the CONFIG_DVB_TEST_DRIVERS kernel config option
      is enabled, which is not enabled in any supported Ubuntu kernel
      configuration. Therefore, Ubuntu kernels are not affected.
    unfixed upstream as of 2023.10.16
