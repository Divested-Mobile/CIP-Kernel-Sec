    Introduced in 6.0 by commit 32dd59f96924 "tty: n_gsm: fix race
    condition in gsmld_write()" which was backported to stable
    branches.  There was an unsuccessful attempt to fix this in
    commit 902e02ea9385 "tty: n_gsm: avoid call of sleepingfunctions
    from atomic context" which has been reverted.
