  debian/bwh: |-
    I don't think this has security impact, as it requires creating
    an MTD with a specific erasesize.  Several drivers support that
    but they all have to be configured through module parameters
    or the kernel command line.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: unfixed as of 2023.06.14
ignore:
  debian/buster-security: Not a security issue
