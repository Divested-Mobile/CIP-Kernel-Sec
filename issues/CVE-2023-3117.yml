description: |-
  A use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux
  kernel when processing named and anonymous sets in batch requests, which
  can lead to performing arbitrary reads and writes in kernel memory. This
  flaw allows a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to crash or
  potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
