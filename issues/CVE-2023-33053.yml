    Bug is in the qcom_mdt_read_metadata() in the
    drivers/soc/qcom/mdt_loader.c. This function was introduced by
    commit 498b98e ("soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Support loading non-split
    images"). No CIP member enables CONFIG_QCOM_MDT_LOADER.
  ubuntu/cascardo: Fix is not upstream, but only on qcom trees.
