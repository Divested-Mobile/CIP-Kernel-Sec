description: |-
  A flaw was found in the MCTP protocol in the Linux kernel. The function
  mctp_unregister() reclaims the device's relevant resource when a netcard
  detaches. However, a running routine may be unaware of this and cause the
  use-after-free of the mdev->addrs object, potentially leading to a denial
  of service.
