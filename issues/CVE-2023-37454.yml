  debian/carnil: |-
    There might be no upstream fix for it from upstream. As by
    stated on the upstream thread about the issue: the reproducer
    does modify the block device while the filesystem is mounted.
  ubuntu/cengizcan: CVE disputed September 2023. Won't fix.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    according to upstream, this is syzkaller corrupting a mounted
      loopback device by writing directly to the device while it's mounted.
      Upstream is unlikely to fix this, other than by having the fuzzer not
      do that.
