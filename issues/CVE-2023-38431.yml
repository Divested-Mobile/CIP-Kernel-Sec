description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.8.
  fs/smb/server/connection.c in ksmbd does not validate the relationship
  between the NetBIOS header's length field and the SMB header sizes, via
  pdu_size in ksmbd_conn_handler_loop, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

    needs ksmbd-tools installed to enable the service, which is
      not installed by default.
