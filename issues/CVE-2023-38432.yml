description: |-
  An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.10.
  fs/smb/server/smb2misc.c in ksmbd does not validate the relationship
  between the command payload size and the RFC1002 length specification,
  leading to an out-of-bounds read.

    needs ksmbd-tools installed to enable the service, which is
