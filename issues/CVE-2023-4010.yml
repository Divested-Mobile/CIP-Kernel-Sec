  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    issue is not clear; the function the reporter mentions
      does not exist. though there is the similar usb_giveback_urb_bh().
      However, as of 6.3.7, which the reporter claims is vulnerable,
      that function contained no gotos, though it did until 26c6c2f8a907
      ("USB: HCD: Fix URB giveback issue in tasklet function"), which
      landed in v6.0-rc1.
