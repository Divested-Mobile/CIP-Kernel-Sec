description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  ksmbd: validate session id and tree id in compound request
  `smb2_get_msg()` in smb2_get_ksmbd_tcon() and smb2_check_user_session()
  will always return the first request smb2 header in a compound request.
  if `SMB2_TREE_CONNECT_HE` is the first command in compound request, will
  return 0, i.e. The tree id check is skipped.
  This patch use ksmbd_req_buf_next() to get current command in compound.
