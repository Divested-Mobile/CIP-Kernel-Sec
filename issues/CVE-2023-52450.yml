  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix NULL pointer dereference issue in
  upi_fill_topology()
  Get logical socket id instead of physical id in discover_upi_topology()
  to avoid out-of-bound access on 'upi = &type->topology[nid][idx];' line
  that leads to NULL pointer dereference in upi_fill_topology()
