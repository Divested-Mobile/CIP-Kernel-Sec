comments:
  cip/cip-kernel-sec: Introduced commit is not determined.Fixed in v6.8-rc1.
  cip/masami: "Backporting this fix to 6.1 was failed \n(https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2024012756-pauper-underdog-470b@gregkh/).\n\
    The dc_dmub_srv.h and dc_dmub_srv.c were introduced by commit 3a1627b073 \n(\"\
    drm/amd/display: Add DMUB support to DC\") in 5.6-rc1. The dmub_psr.c was \nintroduced\
    \ by commit 4c1a1335d (\"drm/amd/display: Driverside changes to \nsupport PSR\
    \ in DMCUB\") in 5.6-rc1. Therefore, it looks as if 5.4 and 4.x \nare not affected."
  debian/carnil: First introducing commit could not be determined.
