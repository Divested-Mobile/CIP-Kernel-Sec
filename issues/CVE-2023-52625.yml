comments:
  cip/cip-kernel-sec: Introduced commit is not determined.Fixed in v6.8-rc1.
  cip/masami: "Backporting this fix to 6.1 was failed \n(https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2024012743-shortcake-unsure-ebfd@gregkh/).\n\
    The dc_dmub_srv.h and dc_dmub_srv.c were introduced by commit 3a1627b073 \n(\"\
    drm/amd/display: Add DMUB support to DC\") in 5.6-rc1. The dcn35_hwseq.c \nwas\
    \ introduced by commit 6f8b7565 (\"drm/amd/display: Add DCN35 HWSEQ\"). \nSo that\
    \ it looks as if at least prior to Linux 5.6 kernels are not affected."
  debian/carnil: First introducing commit could not be determined.
