    Issue introduced with 855b7717f44b1 ("nvme: fine-granular
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN for nvme io commands") in 6.2-rc1.
    To exploit the issue it's still required that root changes the
    device node persmissions. Though this was allowed unter the
    assumtion it was safe to allow (which turns out not to be).
