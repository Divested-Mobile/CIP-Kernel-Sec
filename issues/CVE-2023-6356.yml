comments:
  debian/bwh: |-
    There has never been a nvmet_tcp_build_iovec() function in
    nvmet, but I think this is fixed by commit efa56305908b
    "nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid
    H2C PDU length" which mentions nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().
    Fixed as well in 6.6.14 and 6.7.2.
  ubuntu/rodrigo-zaiden: |-
    fixes for CVE-2023-6536, CVE-2023-6535, and CVE-2023-6356
     are all the same. the differences between the CVEs are that they were
     reported against different methods.
    NULL pointer dereference in nvmet_tcp_build_iovec
    USN-6765-1 for linux-oem-6.5 wrongly stated that this CVE
     was fixed in version 6.5.0-1022.23. The mentioned notice was revoked and
     the state of the fix for linux-oem-6.5 was recovered to the previous
     state.
