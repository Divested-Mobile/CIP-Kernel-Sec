  debian/bwh: |-
    I think this is fixed by commit 0849a5441358 "nvmet-tcp:
    fix a crash in nvmet_req_complete()"; that mentions
    nvmet_req_complete() which is a thin wrapper for
    __nvmet_req_complete()).  Fixed as well in 6.6.14 and 6.7.2.
  ubuntu/rodrigo-zaiden: |-
    fixes for CVE-2023-6536, CVE-2023-6535, and CVE-2023-6356
     are all the same. the differences between the CVEs are that they were
     reported against different methods.
    NULL pointer dereference in __nvmet_req_complete
    USN-6765-1 for linux-oem-6.5 wrongly stated that this CVE
     was fixed in version 6.5.0-1022.23. The mentioned notice was revoked and
     the state of the fix for linux-oem-6.5 was recovered to the previous
     state.
  ubuntu/sbeattie: unfixed upstream as of 2024-01-22
