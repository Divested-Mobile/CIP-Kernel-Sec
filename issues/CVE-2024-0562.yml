description: |-
  A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. When a disk is
  removed, bdi_unregister is called to stop further write-back and waits for
  associated delayed work to complete. However, wb_inode_writeback_end() may
  schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed, which can
  result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.
