    It looks like commit 1f4a08fed ("ALSA: hda: fix a possible
    null-pointer dereference due to data race in
    snd_hdac_regmap_sync()") fixes this vulnerability but
    accessing to the bugzilla 
    (https://bugzilla.openanolis.cn/show_bug.cgi?id=8148) is
    restricted now so we need to wait for sometime.
