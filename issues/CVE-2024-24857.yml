    patch "Bluetooth: Fix atomicity violation in
      conn_info_{min,max}_age_set" has not landed in the upstream kernel as
      of 2024.02.16
    proposed patch references as fixing 40ce72b1951c
      ("Bluetooth: Move common debugfs file creation ...") but it looks
      like the race condition existed since the introduction of the
      conn_info_{min,max}_age_set() functions.
