  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  net: netdevsim: don't try to destroy PHC on VFs
  PHC gets initialized in nsim_init_netdevsim(), which
  is only called if (nsim_dev_port_is_pf()).
  Create a counterpart of nsim_init_netdevsim() and
  move the mock_phc_destroy() there.
  This fixes a crash trying to destroy netdevsim with
  VFs instantiated, as caught by running the devlink.sh test:
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000b8
      RIP: 0010:mock_phc_destroy+0xd/0x30
