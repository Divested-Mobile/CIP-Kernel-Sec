  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  bpf: Fix re-attachment branch in bpf_tracing_prog_attach
  The following case can cause a crash due to missing attach_btf:
  1) load rawtp program
  2) load fentry program with rawtp as target_fd
  3) create tracing link for fentry program with target_fd = 0
  4) repeat 3
  In the end we have:
  - prog->aux->dst_trampoline == NULL
  - tgt_prog == NULL (because we did not provide target_fd to link_create)
  - prog->aux->attach_btf == NULL (the program was loaded with
  attach_prog_fd=X)
  - the program was loaded for tgt_prog but we have no way to find out which
  one
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058
