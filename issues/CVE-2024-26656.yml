  cip/cip-kernel-sec: Introduced commit is not determined.Fixed in v6.9-rc1.
  cip/masami: |-
    It looks as if commit 62914a99 ("drm/amdgpu: Use mmu_interval_insert instead 
    of hmm_mirror") in 5.5-rc1 or 81fa1af31 ("drm/amdgpu: Use mmu_interval_notifier
    instead of hmm_mirror") in 5.5-rc1 are suspecious. So, prior to Linux 5.5 may
    not be affected. 
  debian/carnil: First introducing commit could not be determined.
