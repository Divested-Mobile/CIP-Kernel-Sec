  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  crypto: arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input
  The bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128
  bytes, and will fall back to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or
  inputs that are shorter than 128 bytes to begin with.
  It will call straight into the plain NEON asm helper, which performs all
  memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (the size of a NEON register).
  For this reason, the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs
  shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer, given that this is a rare
  occurrence and it is not worth the effort to work around this in the asm
  code.
  The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON version fails to take this into
  account, potentially resulting in out-of-bounds accesses. So clone the
  same workaround, and use a temp buffer for short in/outputs.
