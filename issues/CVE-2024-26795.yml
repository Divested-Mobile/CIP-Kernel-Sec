description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  riscv: Sparse-Memory/vmemmap out-of-bounds fix
  Offset vmemmap so that the first page of vmemmap will be mapped
  to the first page of physical memory in order to ensure that
  vmemmapâ€™s bounds will be respected during
  pfn_to_page()/page_to_pfn() operations.
  The conversion macros will produce correct SV39/48/57 addresses
  for every possible/valid DRAM_BASE inside the physical memory limits.
