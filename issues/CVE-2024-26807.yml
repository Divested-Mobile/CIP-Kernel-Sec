  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  spi: cadence-qspi: fix pointer reference in runtime PM hooks
  dev_get_drvdata() gets used to acquire the pointer to cqspi and the SPI
  controller. Neither embed the other; this lead to memory corruption.
  On a given platform (Mobileye EyeQ5) the memory corruption is hidden
  inside cqspi->f_pdata. Also, this uninitialised memory is used as a
  mutex (ctlr->bus_lock_mutex) by spi_controller_suspend().
