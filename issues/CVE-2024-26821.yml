  ubuntu/sbeattie: |-
    the issue being addressed here loosens the restrictions on
     remounting /, to match prior allowed behavior. The only potential
     security impact is if, as part of the boot process, an adjustment of /
     attributes was expected to occur that didn't, enabling an unexpected
     operation to be able to occur.
