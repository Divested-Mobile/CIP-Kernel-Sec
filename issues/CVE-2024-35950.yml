comments:
  cip/cip-kernel-sec: Introduced commit is not determined.Fixed in v6.9-rc4.
  cip/masami: "It looks as if 4.19 may be affected too. The drm_setup_crtcs() which\
    \ was \nrenamed to drm_client_modeset_probe() by commit aafa9e06 (\"drm/fb-helper:\
    \ \nPrepare to move out modeset config code\") runs same steps as \ndrm_client_modeset_probe()\
    \ does. Linux 4.4 does not take lock in the \ndrm_setup_crtcs(). so Linux 4.4\
    \ may not be affected."
  debian/carnil: First introducing commit could not be determined.
