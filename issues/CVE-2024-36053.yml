description: |-
  In the mintupload package through 4.2.0 for Linux Mint, service-name
  mishandling leads to command injection via shell metacharacters in
  check_connection, drop_data_received_cb, and Service.remove. A user can
  modify a service name in a ~/.linuxmint/mintUpload/services/service file.
