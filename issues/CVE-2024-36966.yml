  cip/cip-kernel-sec: There is no mention of the commit that introduced the bug in
    the CVE announcement.Fixed in v6.9-rc7.
  cip/masami: "This bug depends on the status of the EROFS_FS_ONDEMAND option. This\
    \ option was \nintroduced by commit c6be2bd0 (\"erofs: register fscache volume\"\
    ) in 5.19-rc1.\nAlso commit 9c0cc9c7 (\"erofs: add 'fsid' mount option\") in 5.19-rc1\
    \ changes \nerofs_kill_sb() to support on-demand read sementics. It seems as if\
    \ commit\n9c0cc9c7 causes this bug."
