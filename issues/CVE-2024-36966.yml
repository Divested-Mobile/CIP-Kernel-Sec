comments:
  cip/cip-kernel-sec: There is no mention of the commit that introduced the bug in
    the CVE announcement.Fixed in v6.9-rc7.
  cip/masami: |-
    This bug depends on the status of the EROFS_FS_ONDEMAND option. This option was 
    introduced by commit c6be2bd0 ("erofs: register fscache volume") in 5.19-rc1.
    Also commit 9c0cc9c7 ("erofs: add 'fsid' mount option") in 5.19-rc1 changes 
    erofs_kill_sb() to support on-demand read sementics. It seems as if commit
    9c0cc9c7 causes this bug.
  debian/carnil: First introducing commit could not be determined.
