description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()
  xattr in ocfs2 maybe 'non-indexed', which saved with additional space
  requested.  It's better to check if the memory is out of bound before
  memcmp, although this possibility mainly comes from crafted poisonous
  images.
