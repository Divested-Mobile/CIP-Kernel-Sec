    A block layer cache") in 3.10-rc1.
  debian/carnil: |-
    First introducing commit could not be determined.
    In 8c8d2d9670e8 ("bcache: move closures to lib/") the code
    moved from drivers/md/bcache/closure.c to lib/closure.c as
    preparation work for bcachefs. The code affects as well
    CONFIG_BCACHE which is enabled before this move.
