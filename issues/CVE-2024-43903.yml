comments:
  cip/cip-kernel-sec: There is no mention of the commit that introduced the bug in
    the CVE announcement.Fixed in v6.11-rc1.
  cip/masami: |-
    It looks as if this bug was introduced by commit 5d945cbc ("drm/amd/display:
    Create a file dedicated to planes") in 6.0-rc1.
  debian/carnil: First introducing commit could not be determined.
  ubuntu/bjamison: |-
    The break commit is when ‘crtc', ‘crtc_state', 'amdgpu_crtc', and
     'address' are initialized without validating that 'afb' is not NULL. In commit
     5d945cb (drm/amd/display: Create a file dedicated to planes) these allocations
     are moved from 'drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c’ to
     'drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_plane.c’.
