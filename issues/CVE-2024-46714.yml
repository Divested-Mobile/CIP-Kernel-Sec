description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  drm/amd/display: Skip wbscl_set_scaler_filter if filter is null
  Callers can pass null in filter (i.e. from returned from the function
  wbscl_get_filter_coeffs_16p) and a null check is added to ensure that is
  not the case.
  This fixes 4 NULL_RETURNS issues reported by Coverity.
