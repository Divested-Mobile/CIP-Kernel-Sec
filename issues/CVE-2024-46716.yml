description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  dmaengine: altera-msgdma: properly free descriptor in
  msgdma_free_descriptor
  Remove list_del call in msgdma_chan_desc_cleanup, this should be the role
  of msgdma_free_descriptor. In consequence replace list_add_tail with
  list_move_tail in msgdma_free_descriptor.
  This fixes the path:
     msgdma_free_chan_resources -> msgdma_free_descriptors ->
     msgdma_free_desc_list -> msgdma_free_descriptor
  which does not correctly free the descriptors as first nodes were not
  removed from the list.
