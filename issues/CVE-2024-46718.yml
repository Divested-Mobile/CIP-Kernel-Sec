  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  drm/xe: Don't overmap identity VRAM mapping
  Overmapping the identity VRAM mapping is triggering hardware bugs on
  certain platforms. Use 2M pages for the last unaligned (to 1G) VRAM
  chunk.
  v2:
   - Always use 2M pages for last chunk (Fei Yang)
   - break loop when 2M pages are used
   - Add assert for usable_size being 2M aligned
  v3:
   - Fix checkpatch
