  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  drm/amd/display: Fix incorrect size calculation for loop
  [WHY]
  fe_clk_en has size of 5 but sizeof(fe_clk_en) has byte size 20 which is
  lager than the array size.
  [HOW]
  Divide byte size 20 by its element size.
  This fixes 2 OVERRUN issues reported by Coverity.
