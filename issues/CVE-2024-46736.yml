  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  smb: client: fix double put of @cfile in smb2_rename_path()
  If smb2_set_path_attr() is called with a valid @cfile and returned
  -EINVAL, we need to call cifs_get_writable_path() again as the
  reference of @cfile was already dropped by previous smb2_compound_op()
  call.
