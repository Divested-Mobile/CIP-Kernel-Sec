  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  binder: fix UAF caused by offsets overwrite
  Binder objects are processed and copied individually into the target
  buffer during transactions. Any raw data in-between these objects is
  copied as well. However, this raw data copy lacks an out-of-bounds
  check. If the raw data exceeds the data section size then the copy
  overwrites the offsets section. This eventually triggers an error that
  attempts to unwind the processed objects. However, at this point the
  offsets used to index these objects are now corrupted.
  Unwinding with corrupted offsets can result in decrements of arbitrary
  nodes and lead to their premature release. Other users of such nodes are
  left with a dangling pointer triggering a use-after-free. This issue is
  made evident by the following KASAN report (trimmed):

    ==================================================================
  To avoid this issue, let's check that the raw data copy is within the
  boundaries of the data section.
