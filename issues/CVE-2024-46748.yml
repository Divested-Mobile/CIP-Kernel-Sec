description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  cachefiles: Set the max subreq size for cache writes to MAX_RW_COUNT
  Set the maximum size of a subrequest that writes to cachefiles to be
  MAX_RW_COUNT so that we don't overrun the maximum write we can make to the
  backing filesystem.
