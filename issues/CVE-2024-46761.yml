  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  pci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv
  The hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c) causes a kernel
  crash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge from
  the PHB.
  The crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been
  released during disable/hot-unplug path and it has been assigned
  with NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying to
  explicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference and
  kernel crash.
  The patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invoking
  pci_disable_msi/msix() since its data structure is already freed.
