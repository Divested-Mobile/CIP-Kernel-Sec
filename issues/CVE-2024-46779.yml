description: |-
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  drm/imagination: Free pvr_vm_gpuva after unlink
  This caused a measurable memory leak. Although the individual
  allocations are small, the leaks occurs in a high-usage codepath
  (remapping or unmapping device memory) so they add up quickly.
