description: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\
  pinctrl: nuvoton: fix a double free in ma35_pinctrl_dt_node_to_map_func()\n'new_map'\
  \ is allocated using devm_* which takes care of freeing the\nallocated data on device\
  \ removal, call to\n\t.dt_free_map = pinconf_generic_dt_free_map\ndouble frees the\
  \ map as pinconf_generic_dt_free_map() calls\npinctrl_utils_free_map().\nFix this\
  \ by using kcalloc() instead of auto-managed devm_kcalloc()."
