  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  parport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access
  The recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()
  calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the
  would-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length
  calculation can still go over the given limit.
  Use scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually
  output letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds access
  properly.
