  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
  ublk: don't allow user copy for unprivileged device
  UBLK_F_USER_COPY requires userspace to call write() on ublk char
  device for filling request buffer, and unprivileged device can't
  be trusted.
  So don't allow user copy for unprivileged device.
